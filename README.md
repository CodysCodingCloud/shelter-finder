# Shelter Finder

This application was built to help homeless people find shelter in their community. The current data that is a part of the database only holds drop-in centers in New York City ast this time. Seed Data collection will be handled from a different application. After completion, users would be able to update and add new shelters to the database as needed.

At this time users will be able to search for shelters based on MongoDB's search features. Results would be displayed and paginated using infinite scrolling.

Future features that I would like to add is mapping and using location data for initial database querries. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

This will start both the Reat hotloading, and the databse connection.
