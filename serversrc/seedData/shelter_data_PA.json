The residence sometimes also receive case management services from the VAMC treatment programs, Riverside's out patient program, and Open Arms steps program.\n\nTransitional Housing\n\nTwo homes adjacent to the 'Atkinson Center' have been rehabilitated into transitional housing. Three men (one man per bedroom) share each of the homes. Men that are moving toward self-sufficiency, yet need additional support (like time to build up their credit) are invited to transfer from the shelter to the transitional homes. The men work, pay a rental fee and usually continue their meals at the shelter.\n\nPermanent Housing\n\nThree townhouses built by AMSCI and located one block from the Atkinson Center are supportive homes to eight men. These men either work or on long term disability. They continue supportive services with an assigned case manager and an on-site facilities manager.

The Supportive Housing Program (SHP) staff and client families work together as a team to set and accomplish the goals each family needs to meet in order to live independently. This plan may include additional schooling or job trainings. It may be a plan which is focused on saving money while employed. Whatever the case may be, the client family drives the planning, and our staff is simply present to support the family as needed.\n\nBridge & Home Stabilization Programs\nWhen families complete a stay at a BCHG Supportive Housing Program site, they may need more time to accomplish the goals they hope to meet. At that point, families may be referred to the Bridge and Home Stabilization Program.\nThe Bridge and Home Stabilization programs are intended to provide subsidized rental assistance and social services to homeless families with at least one child under the age of 18.Â  Both programs provide housing in scattered-site rental properties. The program accommodates approximately 50 families at a time.Â  Rental subsidy and social services are provided and families may choose to maintain those apartments independently when they complete the program.\n\n\nWhile families are in the Bridge and Home Stabilization Programs,Â  we continue to support each family by providing access to food pantries and other funding assistance they may need. Our goal is to continue our strong support in order that the families are successful and reach the goal of independent housing.\n"

The Veteran's Home is a collaboration between Pittsburgh Veterans Affair's Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV), Comprehensive Homeless Center (CHC) and Shepherd's Heart Fellowship, a parish of the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh. The collaboration aims to achieve a continuum of care for homeless Veterans. There are approximately 1500 homeless veterans on any given night in Allegheny County. In 2006, Shepherd's Heart Fellowship was awarded a grant from the VA to renovate the second floor of the church and turn it into an \" Engagement Center\". The program aims to service male and female veterans who are homeless and may have posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance abuse problems, mental illness, dual diagnosis, and those who are disabled.\n\nShepherd's Heart is located on the second floor of Shepherd's Heart Fellowship at 13 Pride Street in the Uptown area of Pittsburgh. The first floor contains offices, and the third floor is a large worship center. Previously, the second floor had been a medical center; 10 former examination rooms have been converted into bedrooms. Five beds serve as shelter beds for those moving from the streets into the CHC, and other five beds will be transitional beds for those who have finished the CHC program. In addition to the bedrooms, there is a kitchen, a great room (dining and social room), a laundry facility, and 2 restrooms with showers. The facility is handicap accessible. Bus stops are located close by for easy access to transportation. Three meals a day are provided by SHVH."

    "description": "Provides food, clothing and shelter for those in need in Erie County and throughout the world.\n\nEmergency Shelter\nCOC provides emergency and transitional shelter to homeless individuals (single adults). Unfortunately we do not have facilities for families and children.\nResidents receive a safe bed with bedding, bathroom and laundry facilities. They also receive 3 meals and a snack daily. We provide links to other services which will help them reach their goals (These goals are usually permanent housing and a stable income.)\n\nResidents must follow simple standards of behavior and are expected to participate in the life of the community by doing chores. If they have income, they are expected to contribute $110/month in shared expense. People with food stamps share a portion of their monthly allocation to help defray the cost of meals and coffee. If someone does not have income we dont kick them out! We help them try to move forward.\n\nHot Meals\nA hot meal is served at noon each to the community at large. The only requirement to receive a meal is that you be hungry! If you ever have some free time during the day, feel free to come for a free lunch.\nFinally Home Shelter + Care\nThis program provides permanent subsidized housing and support services to up to 10 chronically homeless disabled persons.\nParticipants must meet specific eligibility guidelines to qualify for this program, and are usually referred by someone in Homeless Case Management. For more information or to apply call John Yungwirth or Glinda Atkinson, program coordinator, at 814-456-6661.\n\nFood Pantry\nThe COC Food Pantry distributes food 3 times a week. On Tuesday we offer the areas only pantry specifically for diabetics.\nFood is distributed on Wednesday to the first half of the alphabet from A to L, on Friday to the other half from M to Z.\n\nTo receive services people must meet income guidelines and live within our service area as determined by Second Harvest Food Bank of Northwest Pennsylvania.\n\nDayenu House\nIntergenerational Family Support Center\nDayenu\" (Dye-yay-noo) is a Hebrew word meaning \"enough\". Its an expression of gratitude. Its a way of appreciating all that God has done for us.\nThis community center on the corner of 21st and German is located near the geographical center of the city of Erie. It serves as a location for meals, activities, and events.\n\nEvery Sunday a Sunday Family Dinner is served free of charge to anyone who comes. Dinner starts at 3 p.m. and includes some scripture, praise and meditations.\nIn the summer Dayenu House is the location for the Summer Launch Program, which provides food to children and job training to teens."

    "description": "Family Promise of Carbon County is a nonprofit 501c (3) organization serving homeless and low income families in the county and surrounding area. We utilize existing resources in our churches to form a network of 12 host congregations who are willing to house homeless families in their buildings for 7 consecutive nights, 4 times per year. We also have 11 support congregations that help with preparing meals, providing fellowship, and sleeping over with guests.\n\nSUMMARY: Family Promise of Carbon County opened our doors in 2011 and since then have changed the lives of so many people in Carbon county.\n\n\nOur average length of stay is 90 days. We are a sober program and all adults must pass random drug tests and a background check.We are one of over 180 networks across the United States. There are over 4500 congregations and 110,000 volunteers making up these networks. Based on the support of volunteers and Host congregations, Family Promise programs are funded by donations, grants, and fundraising opportunities.\n\nHow we support families in need:Families referred to the program are interviewed by a social worker or program director. If there is space available and the director feels the family is appropriate for the program, they will enter as guests.\n\n\nCommunity churches provide hospitality and fellowship to guests. This includes meals, some supplies and a place to sleep in the evening. During the day, guests are housed at our center in Lehighton. This is where the Director or other staff help families connect with community resources. Each family has a unique set of goals customized to meet their current needs and work toward being self-sufficient.A van and driver is used to help families get to and from the Day Center. While the host congregations change every week, the day center remains the same. This allows the family to have a stable mailing address to use in job and housing searches.\n\n\nVolunteers are what really make this program a reality. They help in providing meals and other items to guests, assist in fundraising, but most importantly take time to sit and talk with guests. Having the ability to connect with others can give you great strength and encouragement. If you were observing this program in action, you may not know who is a guest and who is a volunteer."

HOPES serves as a home-base for those who need a place to stay and assistance to get back into housing. It is not a place to just hang out, but truly a resource center to assist those who want to become self-sufficient. Every guest is assigned a case manager who works with them to establish goals, weekly action steps, and connect them with the appropriate services to help. Additionally, HOPES provides things like food, computer access, phone, laundry, shower facilities, and overnight shelter in the winter months.\n\nAt HOPES, we are in constant need of volunteers. If you or someone you know may be interested in helping, please stop by the Lebanon office to fill out an application. You can also help by donating laundry detergent (HE certified), deodorant, sugar, or canned meals or soups. Items cans be dropped off at the Lebanon office or the resource center at 12 N 9th Street, Lebanon."

We offer Emergency Shelters, Residential Housing, and Housing Support Services across Lancaster and Chester Counties. We serve around 400 men, women, and children every year.\n\nWe also offer many financial stability and personal development resources that holistically and effectively address the needs of participants who are enrolled at Good Sam.\n\n\nWe have locations in Phoenixville, Coatesville, Ephrata, and Lancaster City\n\n\nArthur Perry Emergency ShelterOur Arthur Perry Emergency Shelter is a eight-bed facility that welcomes men experiencing homelessness. Participants are allowed a 60-day stay. During that time, participants are offered three meals a day, clothing, toiletries, linens, and towels. Admission to the shelter begins with a comprehensive interview.\nTransitional Housing\n\nOur transitional housing program can accommodate up to fourteen men. Participants are allowed to reside in the home for up to 12 months. This longer-term residency allows the men to continue to improve their circumstances and prepare for the move into independent living situations. Participants who have completed a successful stay in the Arthur Perry Emergency Shelter may be eligible to reside in the transitional housing. Participants must be employed and/or have another source of regular monthly income. Participants who meet these requirements, complied with the house rules, demonstrated sobriety throughout their stay, and expressed a desire to continue on to independent living are welcomed into our transitional housing.\n\n\nAffordable Housing Breitegam House\nPaul and Helen Breitegam donated their 12-room home to Good Sam in January 2016. This property allows us to provide affordable housing to men who have progressed through our program. Breitegam House allows us to offer a full continuum of services to men experiencing homelessness in Chester County. With the cost of housing making it sometimes impossible for our clients to find independent housing, Breitegam House will be able to provide an affordable housing solution to many men in need."

    "description": "LifePath Christian Ministries aims to love, honor, and serve every person who walks through our doors. The ultimate goal is transformation from the inside out. We start by meeting their immediate needs for food, shelter, clothing, and/or medical care, and then encourage guests to take in our life-changing programs and services.\n\nÂ \nMens' Services\n\nColes drug addiction was out of control. When he lost his job, he hit rock bottom.\n\n\"I was living on the streets, and I literally gave up on life,\" he says. \"I didnt want to end up like that. You dont grow up thinking youre going to be homeless by the age of 30. Its not something you aspire to be. So I wanted to find a way to get back on track.\"\n\n\nThanks to the support of friends like you, Cole is now \"back on track.\"\n\nOur mens services include:\n\nÂ Â Â  a shelter offering meals, beds, clothing, chapel, and supportive guidance. Medical and mental health services are also available.\nÂ Â Â  classes for those who want to improve themselves and be engaged in their own transformation. These classes may include life skills, job preparation, Bible study and more.\n\n\nIt adds up to a holistic approach aiming for spiritual, emotional, vocational, and physical health, with the ultimate goal of equipping men to flourish personally and in the community."
