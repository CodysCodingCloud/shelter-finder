    "description": "We are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nMen's Discipleship\n\nThe Mens Discipleship Program is designed to holistically meet the mental, physical, social, and spiritual needs of the participants. The holistic approach of our structured year-long Mens Discipleship Program promotes a strong mind, body, soul connection that helps to balance all aspects of a persons life. At risk youth 18-24 and all ages of men suffering from abuse or addiction enroll in our programs and learn how to champion everyday life choices and take charge of their health and well-being. Disciples have mentors who walk alongside them, empowering them to face their fears, surrender, and trust Gods spirit within us to guide their actions.\n\nOur weekly bible studies, chapel services, small groups, one-on-one time, and phase classes are helping men experience the unconditional love and forgiveness of our Lord, Jesus Christ, which ultimately leads to a healed heart over the twelve months of the program. Personal experience has taught us that until a person experiences a healed heart, permanent recovery is not possible; therefore, based on results, becoming a disciple is the first step to a life-altering transformation and the beginning to the end of their cycle of deadly behavior.\nWomens Discipleship:\n\nThe percentage of addicted, abused, human trafficked, and homeless women in New Orleans has increased dramatically over the years. The New Orleans Mission is vigorously addressing the crisis to make a positive impact in our region.\n\nThe Womens Discipleship program offers hurting women that are suffering from abuse or addiction, a safe drug and alcohol-free environment where they can focus on their recovery.\n\n\nWhile enrolled in our program, we love, encourage, and minister to the ladies as they begin to regain their health and well-being. A good mind-set ultimately leads to forgiveness and a healed heart. Hope is instilled daily as we provide a source of dignity and purpose for every lady in our program. These women are successfully rebuilding the tattered remnants of their self-worth and are becoming able to fulfill Gods purpose for their life.\n\nOur main womens recovery facility is the Lynhaven Retreat. The Lynhaven is beautiful 18-acre property in Hammond, LA where these hurting women can get out of the distractions of the city and focus on their healing and recovery. We require no insurance or fees for enrollment. The program is completely free to anyone that seeks our support. If you or someone you love needs help, please contact us today.\n\nDesperate Reality-Facing the Truth-Americas only live street rescue program: Our live radio rescue show, Desperate Reality-Facing the Truth, was launched in June of 2016 and is still ministering to the homeless in the streets of our city. The show is hosted by Johnny Lonardo, our COO and Director of Discipleship, who ministers to hurting people over the phone and sends Ministry Outreach teams into the streets of the city to talk to the homeless in their painful circumstances, pray for their safety and for Gods healing. The show airs Saturday nights from 10pm to midnight and provides awareness of the work being done at the Mission to listeners and to the homeless men and women met by our Outreach teams. Several people came to the Mission because of the show and joined the Discipleship program.\nEx-Offender Reentry\n\nThe New Orleans court systems as well as the courts on the North Shore offer many non-violent and first offenders the opportunity of joining our Discipleship Program in lieu of going to jail; over 50 ex-offenders are enrolled in our program monthly and receiving multi-pronged legal, medical, literary tutoring, spiritual enlightenment, and vocational training. We also provide prison ministry regularly at local prisons.\n\nIn 2018, we experience a 20% rise in Drug Court offenders that were mandated to our Discipleship program for group and one-on-one time, Bible classes, and weekly drug screens instead of typical court appointed programs. Many studies have indicated that re-entry initiatives, like ours at the New Orleans Mission, that combine work training with counseling and housing assistance, can greatly reduce recidivism.\n\n\n    The Department of Justices Bureau of Justice Statistics has estimated that nearly 75% of all released prisoners will be rearrested within five years of their release and about 6 in 10 will be reconvicted.\n    The recidivism rate of re-entry Graduates of our Discipleship program is only 15%, significantly lower than the national average.\n    Fines and registration fees for sex offenders have been converted to community service for Disciples of re-entry; to date $130,000 in fees has been converted.\n    Our Re-entry Coordinator maintains a calendar of court dates and ensures transportation to and from court; he accompanies Disciple and speaks to judges on their behalf.\n    We assist in execution of Child Protective Services and D.C.F.S case plans\n    The cost for tax payers to house one offender is $36,639.00 per person per year; our program is saving the parish thousands of dollars housing ex-offenders through our Re-entry program."

We increased capacity and services in our Rights of Passage (ROP) transitional living program, our \"University for Street Kids.\" We further expanded the number of off-site independent apartments available for individuals & families and supportive housing for chronically mentally ill youth. Our newest offsite apartments offer graduating youth \"tapered\" counseling and support until they are fully independent. 60% of our youth come to us from New Orleans, 20% from around Louisiana, and 20% from across the country."

Secondly, individuals and/or families are linked with supportive services found in their communities. Volunteers of America helps the participants determine what housing and support services they need in order to increase the quality of their life.\nThe Housing First program replaced Volunteers of America's Family Emergency Shelter, which had been a staple in the community since 1921. Recent studies show that individuals living within a community setting often took longer to recover financially to move into a permanent setting. Housing First and Rural Supportive Housing transition families into rental homes or apartments. The programs help families get back on their feet.\n\nSupport services are provided on-site and housing is permanent; therefore, participants will not have to move once they have become established. Participants work towards three goals throughout the program: maintain permanent housing, increase skills and/or income, and achieve greater self-determination. Once the participant is able to pay the rent on their own, they will graduate from the program by taking over the lease, which is the goal."

    "description": "The Opelousas Lighthouse Mission is an emergency and transitional shelter for homeless men.  OLM can comfortably accommodate 32 men a night and is open seven days a week three hundred sixty-five days a year.\nOLM provides food, clothing, and assistance with medical and transportation expenses. Men who seek assistance at OLM are expected to help with cleaning, gardening, lawn care and cooking according to the capabilities of each man.\n\nWe operate a vegetable garden year round which is overseen by OLM with important assistance from Southern University.  Our work programs help men gain work skills, build self- esteem and learn teamwork.   As a result of this experience we believe our men will be better prepared to gain employment once they leave the mission.\nThe Lighthouse partners with The St. Landry Parish Drug Court to assist men interested in getting their GEDs.  A job readiness course is also offered and we encourage our able men to take advantage of this opportunity.\nWe are a Christian Agency seeking to lead men to Christ.  We conduct daily morning devotions, weekly bible studies and chapel services.  Our belief is that a foundation rooted in Christian principles is the basis for a fruitful and productive life!\nOur organization strives to serve the needs of this community with love, patience, respect, and honor. We know what it takes to bring dignity back to a man who has been broken and beat down. I know with the power of God that we can accomplish all of our goals here at the Opelousas Lighthouse Mission!"
