      'A faith-based, woman-focused agency headquartered in the Bedford-Stuyvesant community of Brooklyn, Providence House is built around the use of a unique mentoring model at smaller, congregate transitional housing facilities scattered throughout New York City.\nThat model has been fashioned upon the religious Sisters who founded and still perform many of the essential duties running the agency. The Sisters live in the same housing with clients, sharing dinners most weeknights, as well as weekends together. Because of this participation by the Sisters in communal life with residents, they are able to regularly provide counsel and act as informal mentors, creating a much more intimate experience than is typical with larger and more institutional rehabilitation efforts.\n\nProvidence House focuses its programs and services on two at-risk and underserved populations: women and children who are homeless and women recently paroled from prison. Providence House provides women and children in crisis with shelter, food and security as well as support services to help them transition to independence including: enrolling in education or job training programs, searching for employment, obtaining medical services and finding a permanent place to live.\n\nHOMELESS SERVICES PROGRAM\nWe serve some of the more difficult homelessness cases families requiring more intensive supervision and support than larger shelters can provide. At any one time, more than 100 mothers and children are living in our residences.\nWe currently operate three congregate residences in Brooklyn,  Queens with a total of 25 units; a 10-unit congregate residence in Westchester County; and a 15-unit Apartment Program in Brooklyn.\nMothers and young children stay an average of about six to eight months in the program. They have experienced episodic disruptions in their lives brought about as a result of living in poverty.  The women may be victims of domestic violence, may have been forced to leave their parents home after getting pregnant, or may have been living with a relative who asked them to leave.  In most cases, the women served have usually never had their own apartments or found employment. During their stay with us, the women begin the process of learning those skills needed to live independently and to stay out of the cycle of homelessness.\n\nThe social service staff begins to work with all families immediately upon arriving at Providence House; and every family is assessed medically to ensure that they are current with vaccinations and physicals. Case managers work one-on-one with each family to address all obstacles to their ability to live independently and making appropriate referrals for professional help such as mental health screening and anger management.\nThe staff Employment Specialist works individually with each woman to assist her in all areas related to searching for a job.  The staff Housing Specialist bolsters the employment efforts by simultaneously providing assistance in searching for safe and affordable housing. All of the families benefit from our Aftercare Services: we follow-up with them for up to two years after they leave Providence House. This allows the families to benefit from continuity as they adjust to independent living and gives our staff the chance for early intervention if obstacles should arise such as landlord-tenant problems or loss of employment.',

We offer non-judgmental services where each guest's dignity and worth are recognized and respected.\n\n\n\nWe guide guests in getting help from community agencies and act as an advocate to the homeless to address immediate and long-term needs. We provide an opportunity for people from our community to volunteer in service to the homeless.\n\nEmergency Shelters\n\nEmergency Shelter for Adult Men and Women\n24 Beds Single guests sleep in 2- or 3-bed bedrooms and share bathrooms, and common living and dining areas. The shelter is open 24 hours a day, 365 days and nights of the year and runs at close to full occupancy providing almost 8030 nights of shelter to more than 400 single men and women each year. Guests staying in our shelter receive personal care items, three meals a day, use of laundry area and case management assistance with goal setting, identifying and accessing appropriate housing and other special needs.\n\nEmergency Family Shelter\n15 Beds More than 50 families with children are sheltered each year at Joseph's Houseapproximately 170 adults and children for almost 5045 nights of shelter annually. Families are sheltered in apartment-like space set aside from the main section of the shelter and off limits to all other shelter guests. Families sheltered in this space share a living/dining room and a kitchen which allows them to supplement our menu by preparing their own meals, snack and childrens food as necessary. Families are encouraged to eat with the shelter community at our evening meal served family-style. By sheltering families in space which closely resembles and replicates actual apartment like conditions, our staff are much better able to assess the strengths and weaknesses of families while they are living in the shelter. This assessment allows our staff to make much more appropriate and realistic recommendations for permanent housing, and helps us accurately gauge the level of support each family will need, after they leave the shelter.",

      'Homes for the Homeless operates Community Residential Resource Centers (CRRCs) within the shelter infrastructure in an effort to simultaneously serve both homeless families and the surrounding community. Our CRRCs combine the basic services of a traditional shelter with a full range of inclusive programs, such as early childhood education and after-school programming, designed to meet the diverse needs of homeless families residing in the shelter or citizens from surrounding neighborhoods. HFH ensures that a familys future can begin as soon as they walk through the doors of a Community Residential Resource Center.\n\nEach Center provides access to resources where resident families and surrounding community members can find classrooms, libraries, computer labs, playgrounds, and counseling centers. All of these on-site resources make the Centers a place where parents and children can learn and grow as they embark on the path to independence, regardless of their housing status. Mothers drop toddlers off at daycare on their way to work, after-school teachers greet kids as they come home from school, and families bond together at special community events. While students take educational field trips to museums and city landmarks, adults meet with employment and housing specialists who help them prepare for job interviews, learn valuable life skills, and find apartments of their own. On-site New York City Department of Education Liaisons work to ensure that children are enrolled in and attend school. Overall, residents and community members are embraced by a supportive system that encourages individuals and families to grow, achieve, and succeed.\nProspect Family Residence\n\nBronx, NY\nFormer Hospital\nEst. 1986\nHouses 88 Families with approximately 125 Children\nSaratoga Family Residence\n\nQueens, NY\nFormer Hotel\nEst. 1987\nHouses 255 Families with approximately 375 Children\nWilliamsbridge Family Residence\n\nBronx, NY\nFormer Nursing Home\nEst. 2004\nHouses 88 Families with approximately 125 Children',

We are a not-for-profit, volunteer-based organization with a dedicated staff, a broad base of community support and a commitment to educate the public about these issues.\n\nThe INN's emergency shelters provide housing and supportive services for guests experiencing the trauma of homelessness. The INN has three emergency shelters in Nassau County two family shelters and one shelter for single men. The INN shelters are open all year long and staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n \nEach shelter has a social worker to assist guests with crisis intervention and prevention, goal identification and achievement, and overcoming barriers that led to homelessness. The social worker also assists the guests in identifying and developing support systems and services to prevent the future of homelessness. Support staff helps guests to adjust to communal living; ensure a safe, stable, dignified environment; and provide information and referrals.\n \nAdditional services provided to the shelters include educational workshops for the guests on activities of daily living, parenting, employment, nutrition, etc.\n\n\nLong Term Housing\nWe are the only nonprofit organization on Long Island that has a comprehensive program for homeless families, providing safe, well maintained, affordable housing for 23 families, accompanied by a full range of intensive and supportive services. Homeless families who qualify for the program are offered apartments at a reduced rental rate. These families receive case management services to assist them with self-sufficiency goals. These services include counseling and case management, life skills training, tenancy and home management, educational tutoring for children and parents, and vocational training. The program focuses on the elimination of the causes of homelessness so that families can become independent and successfully graduate from our program.\n\nVeterans Housing\nCatherine Martin INN (CMI) provides communal, transitional housing for homeless male veterans who have completed substance abuse rehabilitation programs and have maintained sobriety for at least nine months.\n \nThe CMI program focuses on education and skills for future independence. The veterans receive case management services from licensed social workers who assist tenants in achieving goals leading to self-sufficiency.\n\n \nThese case management services include crisis intervention and prevention, life-skills training, home management, budgeting and educational/vocational training. Referrals are also given for counseling when needed. The rooms are offered at a reduced rental rate to give the veterans an opportunity to focus on their goals.  The INN works closely with the VA in Northport, as well as other veteran agencies, in connecting CMI veterans to the necessary resources.\n\n \nMany of the veterans who have been through CMI have pursued higher education including Bachelor's Degrees, Associate Degrees and various Vocational Certifications. They secured careers with higher incomes and created significant work histories in the fields of their choice, allowing them to move on from the program and launching independent and self-sufficient lives.\n \nDuring their time at CMI, veterans work with their social worker to find ways to repair relationships that were damaged during their time of substance abuse. The veterans at CMI are provided with a support system that provides them with coping skills to carry them through the future when they have finished the program and are successfully on their own.\n\n\n",

Our CRRCs combine the basic services of a traditional shelter with a full range of inclusive programs, such as early childhood education and after-school programming, designed to meet the diverse needs of homeless families residing in the shelter or citizens from surrounding neighborhoods. HFH ensures that a familys future can begin as soon as they walk through the doors of a Community Residential Resource Center.\n\nEach Center provides access to resources where resident families and surrounding community members can find classrooms, libraries, computer labs, playgrounds, and counseling centers. All of these on-site resources make the Centers a place where parents and children can learn and grow as they embark on the path to independence, regardless of their housing status. Mothers drop toddlers off at daycare on their way to work, after-school teachers greet kids as they come home from school, and families bond together at special community events. While students take educational field trips to museums and city landmarks, adults meet with employment and housing specialists who help them prepare for job interviews, learn valuable life skills, and find apartments of their own. On-site New York City Department of Education Liaisons work to ensure that children are enrolled in and attend school.

Our women share the common living space as well as responsibilities for the maintenance, cooking, and governance of their floor in preparation for the day when they will be living independently.\n\nOur Transitional Life Skills Enrichment program educates our women in parenting, career planning, legal advocacy, health, and financial and household management. Each woman also takes personal responsibility for her family's future by attending school, enrolling in a job-training program, or working.\n\n\nOn-site counseling, in the form of mental health and case management, is available to help our women and our children sort through their complex lives. Upon successful completion of our program, we recommend our women for a Section 8 Housing voucher, which subsidizes up to 70% of their rent. To ensure they keep that voucher for as long as they need, it is imperative that they are as ready as possible to succeed on their own.",

      "Emergency Shelter Single Men and Single Women Only, Shelters of Saratoga (SOS) is the only homeless shelter in Saratoga, Washington, or Warren Counties. SOS has been in existence for 16 years.\n\nShelter\nOur shelters provide a home-like environment where houseguests have a safe, structured and sober place to stay.  They are provided with all the amenities of home, a comfortable place to sleep, nutritious meals and much more.  Our shelters can house up to 35 men and women over 18 years of age who are currently homeless. \nHouseguest's have a chance to catch their breath at the shelter. When homeless, it's hard to focus on anything other than where will I sleep tonight Taking that question out of the equation for a period of time allows houseguests to focus on improving themselves, their current state (physical, financial) and their future plans. We provide individualized support through twice weekly case management sessions that help identify and utilize support services that focus on specific needs, such as mental health counseling or drug and alcohol rehabilitation services. We also work with house guests to help them gain independence and stability by assisting them in locating employment, educational opportunities and permanent housing solutions.\n\nDuring a houseguest's stay,  they are expected to follow all house rules including:\n    Adhering to a zero-tolerance policy for drug and alcohol use\n\n    Participating in daily chores to enhance their performance of life skills\n    Volunteering to emphasize the importance of assisting others\n    Leaving the house weekdays from 9am to 4pm to explore employment\n    and housing opportunities\n    Maintaining a nightly curfew\n    Meeting with case managers twice a week for support and guidance\n    Participating in weekly house meetings\n\nEmergency Shelter\nCode Blue Saratoga Springs (CBSS) is an emergency shelter serving individuals who are homeless in the City of Saratoga Springs who might otherwise remain unsheltered during periods of extreme winter weather. CBSS protocols are in place between November 15 and March 15 at The Salvation Army Saratoga Springs, 27 Woodlawn Ave, Saratoga Springs. Extreme winter weather is defined as 12 inches of snow or more and a temperature of 20 degrees (to include wind chill factor) or less. Started in 2013, CBSS was a collaborative effort between the City of Saratoga Springs, faith-based groups, and non-profits serving individuals who are homeless. Code Blue emergency shelter now operates as a standalone program of Shelters of Saratoga.\n\n\nHousing\nAffordable housing remains one of the top most effective solutions to ending homelessness. Shelters of Saratoga owns and manages two residential properties that contain a total of seven apartments, providing affordable housing options to nine individuals in downtown Saratoga Springs.\nThe properties, located at 112 Washington Street and 128 Grand Avenue, promote independent, permanent and safe housing. Through our own services and our network of other local support providers, we work with residents of our affordable housing apartments to identify and provide referrals for any assistance they may need in regards to transportation, nutrition, medical assistance, or financial support. We prioritize placing shelter graduates in our affordable housing units so that we can continue to assist them and enhance their likelihood of permanent success.",

The signature work of the agency, since its inception over 31 years ago, has been the provision of emergency shelter for the Island's homeless in collaboration with local faith-based congregations. We operate a Street Outreach Program, a Drop-In Center for homeless singles, a 67-bed church based shelter network, and emergency housing programs. This division is designed to move persons living on the streets or other places not meant for human habitation to indoor living and to assist them in acquiring the skills needed to achieve independent living in the community.\nAdditionally, Project Hospitality has over 25 years of experience working with runaway and homeless youth. In 2003, PH founded EyeOpeners: Youth Against Violence as a result of bias crimes and racial tension in Staten Island. It is a multi-ethnic, multicultural, anti-discrimination and anti-violence youth rights organization that fosters youth development by improving relations across all social barriers and proactively organizing for social change.\n\nThe agency has been running Staten Island's only Youth Drop-In Center successfully since 2009 and is the sole provider of street outreach, shelter, case management, treatment, support and housing placement for homeless individuals and families in the borough.

      "Joseph's House and Shelter, Inc. is a Troy community-based, not for profit corporation whose purpose is to prevent and alleviate homelessness.\n\n\nOur programs offer emergency shelter, permanent housing, support services, hospitality and guidance to homeless individuals, youth and families. We offer non-judgmental services where each guest's dignity and worth are recognized and respected.\n\n\n\nWe guide guests in getting help from community agencies and act as an advocate to the homeless to address immediate and long-term needs. We provide an opportunity for people from our community to volunteer in service to the homeless.\n\nEmergency Shelters\n\nEmergency Shelter for Adult Men and Women\n24 Beds Single guests sleep in 2- or 3-bed bedrooms and share bathrooms, and common living and dining areas. The shelter is open 24 hours a day, 365 days and nights of the year and runs at close to full occupancy providing almost 8030 nights of shelter to more than 400 single men and women each year. Guests staying in our shelter receive personal care items, three meals a day, use of laundry area and case management assistance with goal setting, identifying and accessing appropriate housing and other special needs.\n\nEmergency Family Shelter\n15 Beds More than 50 families with children are sheltered each year at Joseph's Houseapproximately 170 adults and children for almost 5045 nights of shelter annually. Families are sheltered in apartment-like space set aside from the main section of the shelter and off limits to all other shelter guests. Families sheltered in this space share a living/dining room and a kitchen which allows them to supplement our menu by preparing their own meals, snack and childrens food as necessary. Families are encouraged to eat with the shelter community at our evening meal served family-style. By sheltering families in space which closely resembles and replicates actual apartment like conditions, our staff are much better able to assess the strengths and weaknesses of families while they are living in the shelter. This assessment allows our staff to make much more appropriate and realistic recommendations for permanent housing, and helps us accurately gauge the level of support each family will need, after they leave the shelter.",

      "The INN (Interfaith Nutrition Network) addresses the issues of hunger and homelessness on Long Island by providing food, shelter, long-term housing, and supportive services in a dignified and respectful manner for those who seek our help. We are a not-for-profit, volunteer-based organization with a dedicated staff, a broad base of community support and a commitment to educate the public about these issues.\n\nThe INN's emergency shelters provide housing and supportive services for guests experiencing the trauma of homelessness. The INN has three emergency shelters in Nassau County two family shelters and one shelter for single men. The INN shelters are open all year long and staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n \nEach shelter has a social worker to assist guests with crisis intervention and prevention, goal identification and achievement, and overcoming barriers that led to homelessness. The social worker also assists the guests in identifying and developing support systems and services to prevent the future of homelessness. Support staff helps guests to adjust to communal living; ensure a safe, stable, dignified environment; and provide information and referrals.\n \nAdditional services provided to the shelters include educational workshops for the guests on activities of daily living, parenting, employment, nutrition, etc.\n\n\nLong Term Housing\nWe are the only nonprofit organization on Long Island that has a comprehensive program for homeless families, providing safe, well maintained, affordable housing for 23 families, accompanied by a full range of intensive and supportive services. Homeless families who qualify for the program are offered apartments at a reduced rental rate. These families receive case management services to assist them with self-sufficiency goals. These services include counseling and case management, life skills training, tenancy and home management, educational tutoring for children and parents, and vocational training. The program focuses on the elimination of the causes of homelessness so that families can become independent and successfully graduate from our program.\n\nVeterans Housing\nCatherine Martin INN (CMI) provides communal, transitional housing for homeless male veterans who have completed substance abuse rehabilitation programs and have maintained sobriety for at least nine months.\n \nThe CMI program focuses on education and skills for future independence. The veterans receive case management services from licensed social workers who assist tenants in achieving goals leading to self-sufficiency.\n\n \nThese case management services include crisis intervention and prevention, life-skills training, home management, budgeting and educational/vocational training. Referrals are also given for counseling when needed. The rooms are offered at a reduced rental rate to give the veterans an opportunity to focus on their goals.  The INN works closely with the VA in Northport, as well as other veteran agencies, in connecting CMI veterans to the necessary resources.\n \nMany of the veterans who have been through CMI have pursued higher education including Bachelor's Degrees, Associate Degrees and various Vocational Certifications. They secured careers with higher incomes and created significant work histories in the fields of their choice, allowing them to move on from the program and launching independent and self-sufficient lives.\n \nDuring their time at CMI, veterans work with their social worker to find ways to repair relationships that were damaged during their time of substance abuse. The veterans at CMI are provided with a support system that provides them with coping skills to carry them through the future when they have finished the program and are successfully on their own.\n\n\n",
