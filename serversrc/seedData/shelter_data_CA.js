      "Services Provided:\n\n1. Night Shelter.\n\n\nThe Arcata Night Shelter is a 20 bed emergency shelter facility for single adults. There are separate dorms designated for women and for men. The shelter is in operation 365 days a year.\n\n\n\nClients at the shelter are provided with showers and a warm bed, a hot dinner provided by churches in the community, and a breakfast in the morning.\n\n\n\n\nNight Shelter clients also receive case management, providing crisis management and assisting clients to access medical and social services, as well as assistance in securing and moving into permanent housing.\n\n\n\n2. Transitional Housing Program: The Transitional Housing programs serves families and individuals who are temporarily homeless. Families with children receive first priority.\n\n\n\nArcata House Partnership operates three houses in neighborhoods within the Arcata City limits. Each house has a capacity of six people for a total of 18 residents. A new unit under construction will house an additional four people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo qualify for the Transitional Housing program a family or individual must:\n\n\n\nHave a verifiable source of sufficient income to qualify for permanent housing.\n\nBe at least 18 years of age or be accompanied by a parent.\n\nHave a decent rental history - no evictions or history of property damage.\n\nBe able to live cooperatively with other clients.\n\nBe willing to assist with the care and maintenance of the house.\n\nBe willing to participate in the Arcata House Partnership program and make securing permanent housing the first priority.\n\nAgree to follow house and program rules.\n\n\n\n3. Apartments First: Apartments First! is a Housing First Program for people who are chronically homeless and disabled, usually with serious mental illness. This approach centers on providing housing as quickly as possible and then adding services as needed.\n\n\n\nApartments First Offers:\n\n\n\nPermanent Housing: We help each client locate and sustain affordable housing, usually in an apartment in the private rental market.\n\n\n\nRental Assistance: Clients pay up to 30% of their income in rent to the program; Apartments First! pays the entire amount of rent directly to the landlord.\n\n\n\n\nAssessment: Prospective clients receive a brief assessment before enrollment to determined whether the program will meet the needs. Upon enrollment, each client receives a complete bio-psycho-social assessment to determine how best to support the client in remaining housed.\n\n\n\nSupport Services: Ongoing case management and housing support is provided for as long as it is needed. Each client receives weekly home visits from staff to monitor progress on long and short term goals.\n\n\n\nCrisis intervention and Emergency Services: We will do our best to address issues that arise through mediation, education or advocacy.\n\n\n\nLease Addendum: The lease is in the client's name and the client is the tenant of record. Apartments First! requires that tenants sign an addendum their to lease that affirms their willingness to participate in the program.\n\n\n\nAdditional Support is available to both tenants and landlord. Our staff is available to help resolve problems.\n\n\n\n\nLandlord/Tenant Education: Apartments First! helps people learn the skills necessary to become long-term successful tenants.\n\n\n\n4. Food Assistance:\n\n\n\nRecognizing that people experiencing homelessness lack access to food, Arcata House Partnership works with CalFresh (formerly Food Stamps) to add food security to our mission.\n\n\n\nCalFresh Outreach is accomplished through the Lunch Box food truck, which delivers nutritious meals 4 days a week, enrolling clients for CalFresh.\n\n\n\nThe Gleaner collects food and household goods from grocery stores and food producers, and delivers the food to family resource centers, the night shelter, and individuals, also encouraging CalFresh enrollment.\n\n\n\n",

This shelters main objective is to provide emergency shelter to those women and families who find themselves homeless and often without hope. Crossroads is in the business of restoring hope through the services offered to anyone seeking help.\n\n\nOur mission is to improve the well being of homeless children by providing them with case management and the opportunity to access community services which may help them improve the quality of their lives. The shelter helps the children get through a tough time by building memories in an environment of love and caring staff members. Parents are given the opportunity to access services from Crossroads or other agencies and continue to work or to look for work.\n\nWe offer all of the same services as the Men's Emergency Shelter. We try hard to help women and families achieve an independent lifestyle. We also serve as a refuge for families or women who are escaping an abusive environment. Our case managers work with each family on a case-by-case basis to try to determine which course of action will best help the family. We help with everything from enrolling children in school or daycare to referrals to agencies. Our goal is to provide services that make the least disruption for the children but the most helpful for the parents. Families are important. Crossroads philosophy includes family reunification, support, and functionality.\n\n\nHomeless women can access services by apply at the Family Shelter. The friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable case managers will assist guests with obtaining identification, apply for food stamps or AHCCCS and other important connections to restoring their life to normal.\n\nMeals at Crossroads Mission\nThe kitchen and dining room are the hub of the Mission.  There is non stop activity from 4:00 AM to 7:00 PM.  Over 400 meals are cooked and served each day to hundreds of program participants, overnight guests, and needy people.\n\nOur dinners are always free and open to the public!\n\nEveryday our dining room is visited by hundreds of people.  Some are homeless men, women, and children that will eat their only meal of the day at our table.  Others are individuals and families that have a home but for some reason are not able to make ends meet.\n\nWeekdays:\nBreakfast\n5:30 to 6:30 AM\n\nLunch\n11:30 AM to 12:00 PM\n \nDinner\n5:00 to 6:00 PM\n\nWeekends and Holidays:\nBreakfast\n6:00 to 7:00 AM\n\nLunch\n12:00 to 1:00 PM\n\nDinner\n5:00 to 6:00 PM\n\nAll meals are open to everyone at Crossroads Mission and to the general public.  Anyone can come and eat with us.\n",

Faith centers support the program through providing meals and completing repair projects, which helps decrease the cost of operating the shelters.\nCorinne's Cottage\nCorinne's Cottage provides a safe, nurturing environment for homeless\nolder women living with mental illness. During their time at Corinne's Cottage, the women form friendships and a support system that last far beyond their time at the shelter. The women enter the shelter hopeless and feeling alone. They leave empowered with the tools, confidence, and support systems in place to live successfully.\n\nFrom July 2012 - June 2013, 78% of participants leaving the program graduated successfully with income and housing. A total of 13 women were housed and served during this year period.\nTikkun Home\nTikkun provides temporary shelter for six homeless women with mental illness.

Dinner meals are prepared and donated by local faith centers and community members.\n \nTRANSITIONAL HOUSING\nFamily Housing\nInterfaith provides transitional housing for 32 families in two-bedroom, two bath apartments. Each family works closely with our staff Client Advocates to gain life skills training, vocational assistance, and counseling, as needed, to identify and overcome barriers that have kept them from being self-sufficient.\nThe program also utilizes partner services to offer other skills training as needed, including financial literacy workshops, educational planning, and family therapy to empower our clients and prepare them for a successful transition to permanent housing.\n\nDue to the high volume of applications, potential applicants should first attend an information session on the 2nd or 4th Monday of any month at 3:00 p.m. at 550 West Washington Avenue, Escondido.\nHarmony Place & Eagle's Point\nThis program offers subsidized housing for homeless, mentally ill individuals.

The three shelters, Corinne's Cottage, Tikkun, and the Men's Shelter provides a supportive environment for clients to gain the skills and confidence needed to move on to self-sufficiency. Faith centers support the program through providing meals and completing repair projects, which helps decrease the cost of operating the shelters.\nCorinne's Cottage\nCorinne's Cottage provides a safe, nurturing environment for homeless\nolder women living with mental illness. During their time at Corinne's Cottage, the women form friendships and a support system that last far beyond their time at the shelter. The women enter the shelter hopeless and feeling alone. They leave empowered with the tools, confidence, and support systems in place to live successfully.\n\nFrom July 2012 - June 2013, 78% of participants leaving the program graduated successfully with income and housing. A total of 13 women were housed and served during this year period.\nTikkun Home\nTikkun provides temporary shelter for six homeless women with mental illness. The women at Tikkun are taught life skills by their on-site resident manager and receive case management through Mental Health Systems. Dinner meals are prepared and donated by local faith centers and community members.\n \nTRANSITIONAL HOUSING\nFamily Housing\nInterfaith provides transitional housing for 32 families in two-bedroom, two bath apartments. Each family works closely with our staff Client Advocates to gain life skills training, vocational assistance, and counseling, as needed, to identify and overcome barriers that have kept them from being self-sufficient.\nThe program also utilizes partner services to offer other skills training as needed, including financial literacy workshops, educational planning, and family therapy to empower our clients and prepare them for a successful transition to permanent housing.\n\nDue to the high volume of applications, potential applicants should first attend an information session on the 2nd or 4th Monday of any month at 3:00 p.m. at 550 West Washington Avenue, Escondido.\nHarmony Place & Eagle's Point\nThis program offers subsidized housing for homeless, mentally ill individuals. Harmony is a seven-unit building consisting of one-bedroom/one bath apartments, whereas Eagle's Point are one-bedroom/one-bath apartments that are in another neighborhood. Both offer reduced rental rates.  An onsite resident manager is there to help provide life skills instruction as well as organize community activities to connect residents to one another.\n \nSUPPORTIVE HOUSING\nFairweather Lodge\nCalifornia's first Fairweather Lodges in San Marcos and Escondido provide permanent shared housing and supported part-time employment for mentally ill adults. This program raises the bar for mental health housing demonstrating that disabled adults can live satisfying and productive lives.\nInterfaith's Fairweather Lodge is a permanent housing alternative to traditional Board and Care facilities. This innovative recovery model of supported employment and housing gives high-functioning mentally ill adults the power to live in interdependency where staff acts as advisors, mentors and guidance counselors.\nGuiding Principles of The Fairweather Lodges\n    Housing:  a safe, healthy and caring environment, which reinforces the recovery process\n    Employment: Structured to ensure financial reward for increasing participation in employment\n    Autonomy: Commensurate with behavioral performance, with the ultimate goal of full autonomy\n    Social: a successful lodge resembles a family. Residents share meals and interact in recreational activities",

Transitional Housing Program: The Transitional Housing programs serves families and individuals who are temporarily homeless. Families with children receive first priority.\n\n\n\nArcata House Partnership operates three houses in neighborhoods within the Arcata City limits. Each house has a capacity of six people for a total of 18 residents. A new unit under construction will house an additional four people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo qualify for the Transitional Housing program a family or individual must:\n\n\n\nHave a verifiable source of sufficient income to qualify for permanent housing.\n\nBe at least 18 years of age or be accompanied by a parent.\n\nHave a decent rental history - no evictions or history of property damage.\n\nBe able to live cooperatively with other clients.\n\nBe willing to assist with the care and maintenance of the house.\n\nBe willing to participate in the Arcata House Partnership program and make securing permanent housing the first priority.\n\nAgree to follow house and program rules.\n\n\n\n3. Apartments First: Apartments First! is a Housing First Program for people who are chronically homeless and disabled, usually with serious mental illness. This approach centers on providing housing as quickly as possible and then adding services as needed.\n\n\n\nApartments First Offers:\n\n\n\nPermanent Housing: We help each client locate and sustain affordable housing, usually in an apartment in the private rental market.\n\n\n\nRental Assistance: Clients pay up to 30% of their income in rent to the program; Apartments First! pays the entire amount of rent directly to the landlord.\n\n\n\n\nAssessment: Prospective clients receive a brief assessment before enrollment to determined whether the program will meet the needs. Upon enrollment, each client receives a complete bio-psycho-social assessment to determine how best to support the client in remaining housed.\n\n\n\nSupport Services: Ongoing case management and housing support is provided for as long as it is needed. Each client receives weekly home visits from staff to monitor progress on long and short term goals.\n\n\n\nCrisis intervention and Emergency Services: We will do our best to address issues that arise through mediation, education or advocacy.\n\n\n\nLease Addendum: The lease is in the client's name and the client is the tenant of record.

Our staff is available to help resolve problems.\n\n\n\n\nLandlord/Tenant Education: Apartments First! helps people learn the skills necessary to become long-term successful tenants.\n\n\n\n4. Food Assistance:\n\n\n\nRecognizing that people experiencing homelessness lack access to food, Arcata House Partnership works with CalFresh (formerly Food Stamps) to add food security to our mission.\n\n\n\nCalFresh Outreach is accomplished through the Lunch Box food truck, which delivers nutritious meals 4 days a week, enrolling clients for CalFresh.\n\n\n\nThe Gleaner collects food and household goods from grocery stores and food producers, and delivers the food to family resource centers, the night shelter, and individuals, also encouraging CalFresh enrollment.\n\n\n\n",

      'The Boccardo Family Living Center (BFLC) is a multi service transitional housing program for homeless families with children in South Santa Clara County. Located in the City of San Martin, the program provides 26 units of transitional housing specifically designed to serve one- and two-parent households with children. Families pay a below-market rental rate that allows them to build financial resources while they work to achieve stability.\n\n\nThe BFLC is also home to a four-month emergency shelter program for families that operates from December 1 through March 31, as well as seasonal migrant farm worker housing.\n\nServices\nDuring their stay at BFLC, families receive help reaching goals of permanent housing and improved self-sufficiency. Staff and volunteers also operate a tutoring program for the children who live there. The facility is equipped with a community room, an activity room, and recreational areas.\n\nEligibility\nThe BFLC serves families, which are defined as one- or two-parent households with at least one minor child. Eligible families must have documented homelessness. All residents must show proof of monthly income that is twice the monthly rent of the unit at SFLC.\n\nThe program operates a waiting list for prospective clients. The BFLC waiting list is currently CLOSED.',

We are open year-round and the program operates daily from 5:00 PM - 10:00 AM.\n\nPermanent Supportive Housing\nOur Permanent Supportive Housing program is intended for clients who are chronically homeless and are unable to work due to a disability, including physical or mental health conditions. Clients are housed in scattered-site apartments and receive ongoing supportive services from Friendship Shelter staff. Clients pay 1/3 of their income toward the cost of their rent and the balance is subsidized through funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the State of California Mental Health Services Act (MHSA).",

They hear of the shelter through word of mouth or through referrals from social service agencies. The shelter has gained a reputation for the sense of community and personal attention our clients receive while at GHP. GHP not only provides men with a safe place to dwell, but also teaches clients to take initiative for their own success and to measure this success in terms of the goals they have defined. As a requirement for receiving services through GHP, clients commit to taking proactive steps to transition into permanent housing with the assistance of trained staff and volunteers. Clients meet regularly with their Case Manager to assess progress on their goals, discuss challenges and receive resources and support to achieve independent living. GHP builds the capacity of clients to succeed independently through workshops that foster positive interactions with community members and focus on personal development. These workshops and services occur on-site, and clients who need more extensive help are transported for off-site services in the GHP van. GHP's comprehensive services are listed below.\n\n \n\nWomen's Shelter: In partnership with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, former Supervisor Gloria Molina, the Department of Mental Health, and other agencies, Proyecto Pastoral recently established a pilot Women's Shelter to house vulnerable homeless women currently seeking protection near La Placita Church and in the Boyle Heights community.  Because of Proyecto's expertise in running a men's shelter, the organization was prepared to add this additional shelter to the program.  And the need is great, as it is estimated that there are more than 14,000 homeless women living on the streets of Los Angeles County.  GHP projects the program will serve a total of 60 unduplicated women throughout the year. The women's shelter maintains an overnight manager as well as a day manager, and includes the following components:\n\n\n    - Two rooms of the main headquarters for Proyecto Pastoral are set aside for the 15 bed shelter;\n    - It is a 14-hour, daily, secure shelter for women only;\n    - The women are transported to and from Dolores Mission Church and School where GHP is based;\n    - At that secondary location, they have access to two hot meals daily as well as meet with counselors and take advantage of other services offered by the GHP staff and volunteers;\n    - The shelter facilities include a women-only shower, separate toilet and sink room, changing room, multi-purpose room and sleeping room;\n    - The pilot program will run one year, beginning December 1, 2014 through November 30, 2015;\n\n    - The women have access to the same services as the men's program, including individual case management, job referrals, health referrals, personal savings account, and enrichment and educational classes; and\n    - The women are invited to shop for their specific clothing needs at Proyecto's La Tiendita/Thrift Center at no cost.",

Program goals are to secure sustainable income and secure permanent housing while addressing life issues that led to homelessness.\n\nPermanent Supportive Housing\nAbout 25% of our affordable housing units are considered service enriched permanent supportive housing and are reserved for households with one disabled family member. About 10% of the units are set aside for formerly homeless Veterans.\nHomeless families are 2x more likely to have a disabled household member than the general population.

Please e-mail our team at MantecaCWC@ci.manteca.ca.us with questions.\nCRITERIA FOR OPENING\n\n*Temperatures are based on information provided by the National Weather Service (http://www.weather.gov/)\n\n    Cooling Center will open when temperatures are 104F and above.\n    Warming Center will open when temperatures fall to 31F and below.\n    In addition to one of the two criteria above, the center will open only if there is sufficient staffing.\n\nCOOLING CENTER\n\nSpending a few hours in an air-conditioned environment can bring down the body's core temperature.

Getting out of the cold and into a warming center during the overnight hours can bring much relief from what can be unbearable temperatures.\n\nCope with the COLD!\n\n    Wear layers including hat and gloves\n    Keep as dry as possible\n    Avoid alcohol as it can dilate blood vessels and cause hypothermia\n    Seek shelter and limit outdoor activity\n\nPROHIBITED ITEMS\n\nTo provide a safer environment for the public and expedite entry into the City of Manteca Senior Center, citizens will not be permitted to bring the following items:\n\n    No animals (with the exception of service animals)\n    No drugs, including Marijuana\n    No tobacco products or e-cigarettes\n    No alcohol\n    No personal property (with the exception of a backpack)\n\n*Prohibited items that are discovered by city staff must be discarded or surrendered.

Faith centers support the program through providing meals and completing repair projects, which helps decrease the cost of operating the shelters.\nCorinne's Cottage\nCorinne's Cottage provides a safe, nurturing environment for homeless\nolder women living with mental illness. During their time at Corinne's Cottage, the women form friendships and a support system that last far beyond their time at the shelter. The women enter the shelter hopeless and feeling alone. They leave empowered with the tools, confidence, and support systems in place to live successfully.\n\nFrom July 2012 - June 2013, 78% of participants leaving the program graduated successfully with income and housing. A total of 13 women were housed and served during this year period.\nTikkun Home\nTikkun provides temporary shelter for six homeless women with mental illness. The women at Tikkun are taught life skills by their on-site resident manager and receive case management through Mental Health Systems. Dinner meals are prepared and donated by local faith centers and community members.\n \nTRANSITIONAL HOUSING\nFamily Housing\nInterfaith provides transitional housing for 32 families in two-bedroom, two bath apartments. Each family works closely with our staff Client Advocates to gain life skills training, vocational assistance, and counseling, as needed, to identify and overcome barriers that have kept them from being self-sufficient.\nThe program also utilizes partner services to offer other skills training as needed, including financial literacy workshops, educational planning, and family therapy to empower our clients and prepare them for a successful transition to permanent housing.\n\nDue to the high volume of applications, potential applicants should first attend an information session on the 2nd or 4th Monday of any month at 3:00 p.m. at 550 West Washington Avenue, Escondido.\nHarmony Place & Eagle's Point\nThis program offers subsidized housing for homeless, mentally ill individuals. Harmony is a seven-unit building consisting of one-bedroom/one bath apartments, whereas Eagle's Point are one-bedroom/one-bath apartments that are in another neighborhood. Both offer reduced rental rates.  An onsite resident manager is there to help provide life skills instruction as well as organize community activities to connect residents to one another.\n \nSUPPORTIVE HOUSING\nFairweather Lodge\nCalifornia's first Fairweather Lodges in San Marcos and Escondido provide permanent shared housing and supported part-time employment for mentally ill adults. This program raises the bar for mental health housing demonstrating that disabled adults can live satisfying and productive lives.\nInterfaith's Fairweather Lodge is a permanent housing alternative to traditional Board and Care facilities. This innovative recovery model of supported employment and housing gives high-functioning mentally ill adults the power to live in interdependency where staff acts as advisors, mentors and guidance counselors.\nGuiding Principles of The Fairweather Lodges\n    Housing:  a safe, healthy and caring environment, which reinforces the recovery process\n    Employment: Structured to ensure financial reward for increasing participation in employment\n    Autonomy: Commensurate with behavioral performance, with the ultimate goal of full autonomy\n    Social: a successful lodge resembles a family.

We serve an immensely rural geographic area and a huge population of people in need. Our shelter provides guests with up to 30 days emergency shelter and extended stays where necessary or in situations where steps to self improvement are undertaken such as job search or money savings programs. Including all facilities, in recent years we have averaged nearly 200 guests per night. Your gifts allow us to truly offer a hand up to people in desperate need.\n\nEmergency Shelter\nWe offer shelter to anybody in need, and accept people 24- hours a day, 7-days a week. Our guests have access to sleeping and bathing facilities for both men and women, and accommodations are provided to their children accordingly. Also available to our guests are pajamas, bedding and toiletries to those who are utilizing our emergency shelter, as well as fresh daily clothing for those in need.\n\nLong Term Shelter\nOnce here, our guests do an intake interview where their needs are assessed and a plan is established to obtain long term housing. If an individual does not have a source of income, we develop a plan together to get them stable income. This is usually where they have the option of our Work Search Program, but can also mean a referral to the Veterans Resource Center, the Social Security Office, Employment Development Department, or Cal-Works if they have children. Once an income is acquired that is able to sustain them once they leave here, our guests have the opportunity to be a part of our money savings program. They are able to save money for a few months while receiving shelter at the Mission to build up their savings for a security deposit and necessary housing expenses.\nThe Mission also provides long term shelter for men and women who are enrolled in our long term recovery program. Our students live on site for 13 months during the first four phases of their individualized program.\n\nTransitional Housing\nWe have many agencies that we refer our guests to, including multiple transitional housing facilities to meet various needs. There are sober-living facilities, board and care facilities, mental-health specialty facilities, and gender specific housing available.\nIn addition, the Mission offers transitional housing for our students who are enrolled in the long term recovery program. Housing is available for the students during their fifth and final phase for up to 5 months and is located off site.",

      "The Good News Rescue Mission is Shasta County's only homeless shelter and the only AGRM shelter in the Sacramento Valley north of Oroville and south of Medford/Klamath Falls. We serve an immensely rural geographic area and a huge population of people in need. Our shelter provides guests with up to 30 days emergency shelter and extended stays where necessary or in situations where steps to self improvement are undertaken such as job search or money savings programs. Including all facilities, in recent years we have averaged nearly 200 guests per night. Your gifts allow us to truly offer a hand up to people in desperate need.\n\nEmergency Shelter\nWe offer shelter to anybody in need, and accept people 24- hours a day, 7-days a week. Our guests have access to sleeping and bathing facilities for both men and women, and accommodations are provided to their children accordingly. Also available to our guests are pajamas, bedding and toiletries to those who are utilizing our emergency shelter, as well as fresh daily clothing for those in need.\n\nLong Term Shelter\nOnce here, our guests do an intake interview where their needs are assessed and a plan is established to obtain long term housing. If an individual does not have a source of income, we develop a plan together to get them stable income. This is usually where they have the option of our Work Search Program, but can also mean a referral to the Veterans Resource Center, the Social Security Office, Employment Development Department, or Cal-Works if they have children. Once an income is acquired that is able to sustain them once they leave here, our guests have the opportunity to be a part of our money savings program. They are able to save money for a few months while receiving shelter at the Mission to build up their savings for a security deposit and necessary housing expenses.\nThe Mission also provides long term shelter for men and women who are enrolled in our long term recovery program. Our students live on site for 13 months during the first four phases of their individualized program.\n\nTransitional Housing\nWe have many agencies that we refer our guests to, including multiple transitional housing facilities to meet various needs. There are sober-living facilities, board and care facilities, mental-health specialty facilities, and gender specific housing available.\nIn addition, the Mission offers transitional housing for our students who are enrolled in the long term recovery program. Housing is available for the students during their fifth and final phase for up to 5 months and is located off site.",

Our 50,000 square foot building includes a commercial kitchen, communal dining room, laundry facilities, health and wellness center, clothes closet, garden roof-top terrace, computer lab where parents acquire and practice technological job skills, library, children classrooms, and state-licensed child development center.\n\nOur San Jose Family Shelter Program focuses on the personal partnership a family forms with on-site Case Managers to develop a detailed customized step-by-step plan leading them to self-sufficiency. In addition to meeting basic needs such as food and shelter, we provide counseling, referrals for housing, employment services, budgeting services, health care services, educational workshops, parenting classes, and ESL education. We also provide evening day care, Voyager Child Development Center, and a mandatory Homework Enrichment Program for all school-age children residing at our San Jose Family Shelter because we believe that an education builds a strong foundation to help break the cycle of homelessness.\n\nAfter Care Program\nFamily Supportive Housing's Bridges AfterCare Program provides families who complete our San Jose Family Shelter Program with 12-24 months of additional supportive services that are designed to stabilize families once they are in permanent housing. Bridges AfterCare allows families to stay connected to a supportive Case Manager while they navigate back into self-sufficient living. This added support model has been crucial to families now living independently.\n\nOur Case Manager works with families in Bridges AfterCare to ensure families have a full transition into self-sufficiency and avoid a relapse into homelessness. This program includes case management, education, home visits, resource sharing, access to the clothes closet, access to healthy food, public transportation assistance, and referrals.\n\nTransitional Housing Program\nOur Glenn Art Arms transitional housing program offers scattered-site apartments for families, who pay 30% of income, receive supportive services and work to become self-sufficient. Prospective clients must be referred by a Case Manager, must be homeless, must have a child in their physical and legal custody, and must reside in Santa Clara County. Once accepted into the GlennArt Arms Transitional Housing Program, families are offered a wide array of supportive services all centered around increasing income and education to be able to support independent living.",

      "Are you and your family homeless? Are you and your family about to become homeless?\nTransition House can help!\nIf you are a Santa Barbara County Resident with a family (single-parent or dual-parent, with children under 18 years old) you may be eligible to stay in our Emergency Shelter. Please call us at (805) 966-9668 to learn about entry into Transition House's McCune Family Shelter located at 434 E. Ortega Street, Santa Barbara.\n\n1. What conditions or criteria must be met to stay at Transition House?\nIn order to be admitted, families must be:\n    Capable and motivated to work towards self-sufficiency.\n    Able and willing to meet weekly with a Case Manager and actively participate in our program, meeting our Goals and Requirements.\n\n    Sober from drugs and alcohol. Everyone 18 years of age and older is drug-tested upon entry.\n    Able and willing to get along within a group-living environment.\n    Willing to complete daily chores and follow House Rules.\nAdmittance is contingent upon bed space availability. Transition House has the capacity to serve 70 clients. Our program is 30-120 days, however, the length of each family's stay is determined by their Intake Interview and by subsequent case management assessments. Families that do not meet our program requirements may be given up to 30 days of respite care only.\n2. Is there a waiting list?\nYes. To get on the waiting list, you must sign-up in person at our Administrative Office, located at 425 E. Cota Street between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Monday - Friday.\n3. If my family is on the waiting list, how long will it take to get in?\nThis depends on several factors, such as how many families are on the waiting list before you, the size of your family, how many beds are available, and whether or not you have previously stayed at Transition House and/or are a Santa Barbara County resident. Once space becomes available, you will be asked to come to 434 E. Ortega Street for an initial assessment and drug test and must enter the shelter that evening. If a room is offered to you and you chose not to enter that night, your name will be dropped from the wait list.\n\nTransition House serves families residing in Santa Barbara County. Before considering a move to the area, first examine the extremely high cost of living including rental housing. Without a job or support network, it is very difficult for families to become self-sufficient. If you are not a resident of Santa Barbara County and are in need of homeless services for yourself and your family we strongly encourage you to click HERE.\n4. What will my family experience at Transition House?\nTransition House provides three meals a day, sleeping quarters for families, linens and toiletries, childcare, assistance with long term goals, education, employment counseling, medical care, counseling referrals, money management help and referrals to other social services agencies.\n5. What will my kids do while staying at Transition House?\nTransition House offers free, fully-licensed childcare for children six weeks to two years old, an evening and weekend Children's Literacy and Enrichment Program, and a Teen Program. Tutoring and other youth-oriented services are also available. Transition House will also provide referrals to other agencies for toddler care and summer camp.\n6. What is the daily schedule at Transition House?\nAll clients are required to be in the Shelter by 5:00 PM each day, unless they are given authorization in advance to be late because of work, school, medical, or counseling and recovery appointments. The shelter is closed from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday, however it is open all day and night on the weekends.\n7. Am I required to do chores at Transition House?\nEveryone works together to keep the house neat and clean through assigned daily chores. All families are expected to keep a clean and tidy room.\n8. What do I do if I work at night?\nTransition House is unable to allow any children to be present in the Shelter without a parent or legal guardian, except in an emergency. Please be prepared to make arrangements for alternative childcare if you will not be in the shelter in the evenings, overnight, or early mornings. On occasion, another adult in the shelter can serve as a temporary guardian.\n9. Will I have my own room?\nTransition House has private family rooms available for large families and two-parent families. Smaller, single-parent families often share rooms with other small, single-parent families.\n10. What will I do with my belongings?\nTransition House provides one drawer for each family member. There is shared closet space available in each room. Storage space is extremely limited.\n11. How long can I stay at Transition House?\nFamilies are given between 30-120 days, depending on their circumstances, goals, and motivation. Extensions past 120 days may be given to those who do well in the program but need more time to establish self-sufficiency.\n12. What do I have to do to succeed at Transition House?\n\nIf you're able and motivated to make the changes necessary to become self-sufficient, and you want to take full advantage of the services and resources our program offers, then you are likely to succeed at Transition House. We seek to assist those who want to improve their lives, and who are ready to work hard and try new ways of approaching challenging issues such as employment, budgeting, education, housing, and family relationships. Ask anyone who has been a past client, Transition House works!",

Shelter is provided every night to 100 men and 24 women. In 2014, the Mission provided 72,304 meals and 32,083 overnight stays for the homeless of Santa Barbara.\nSchedule for our overnight guests:\nEvening\n3:30-4:15 - Women's check-in, luggage storage, and showers.\n6:15-6:45 - Dinner.\n6:15-7:00 - Men's check-in and luggage storage.\n6:45-7:25 - Men's showers.\n7:00-8:00 - Guests may attend chapel services conducted by Santa Barbara community churches.\n9:00 p.m. - Bedtime, lights out.\nMorning\n5:30 a.m.- Wake-up.\n5:30-6:16 - Wash, shave and dress.\n6:15-6:45 - Breakfast.\n6:45 a.m. - Leave Mission for the day.\n\nThe Santa Barbara Rescue Mission has served the county and city of Santa Barbara for 50 years, providing emergency services and long-term recovery for the homeless and addicted. With 80 beds for men and 20 for women and children, we are the only emergency shelter that is open 365 nights of the year from Santa Maria to Ventura. In 2014, we provided 145,669 meals and 56,538 safe nights of shelter for individuals with no place else to turn.\nBecause substance abuse has a sizable impact on our community and is often a contributing factor to homelessness, we focus 85% of our resources on recovery efforts employing both outpatient and residential modalities. The Mission's 12-month residential recovery program aims to bring individuals from decades of addiction, institutionalization, and homelessness back to sobriety, health and wholeness. Certification through the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs ensures that participants receive the highest standard of treatment in a non-medical facility. The recovery programs are operated in two separate (24 W. Arrellaga and 535 E. Yanonali St.) gender-specific locations for 45 men and 24 women. In 2014, 41 people completed the recovery program, joining over 464 graduates since 2000. Our most significant accomplishment is the long-term change we see in our graduates. In contrast to national statistics that show only 21% of those who complete addiction recovery programs not returning to dependency within five years (SAMHSA, 1998), more than 55% of our graduates maintain recovery over this same time period.\n\nThe Rescue Mission's comprehensive programs include outpatient services, family support, addiction education, relapse prevention, transitional housing, career development and placement. Graduates from the Mission are restored to health and productivity and reenter society as responsible, committed parents and citizens.\n\nMen's Recovery\nMen's Residential Treatment Program\nThe Santa Barbara Rescue Mission's Men's Residential Treatment Program is a 12-month, faith-centered, 12-step social model program.

Please e-mail our team at MantecaCWC@ci.manteca.ca.us with questions.\nCRITERIA FOR OPENING\n\n*Temperatures are based on information provided by the National Weather Service (http://www.weather.gov/)\n\n    Cooling Center will open when temperatures are 104F and above.\n    Warming Center will open when temperatures fall to 31F and below.\n    In addition to one of the two criteria above, the center will open only if there is sufficient staffing.\n\nCOOLING CENTER\n\nSpending a few hours in an air-conditioned environment can bring down the body's core temperature. Older or frail adults, homeless people, and persons with health conditions that may be made worse by hot weather should consider spending time in a cooling center, particularly between 1pm and 5pm when temperatures are at their highest.\n\nBeat the HEAT!\n\n    Drink plenty of water\n    Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and large amounts of sugar because they will dehydrate your body\n    Wear sun screen and reapply often\n    Avoid direct sun, seek shade while outdoors\n\nWARMING CENTER\n\nBitter cold temperatures are more than an inconvenience; they can pose a serious threat to health and safety. Getting out of the cold and into a warming center during the overnight hours can bring much relief from what can be unbearable temperatures.\n\nCope with the COLD!\n\n    Wear layers including hat and gloves\n    Keep as dry as possible\n    Avoid alcohol as it can dilate blood vessels and cause hypothermia\n    Seek shelter and limit outdoor activity\n\nPROHIBITED ITEMS\n\nTo provide a safer environment for the public and expedite entry into the City of Manteca Senior Center, citizens will not be permitted to bring the following items:\n\n    No animals (with the exception of service animals)\n    No drugs, including Marijuana\n    No tobacco products or e-cigarettes\n    No alcohol\n    No personal property (with the exception of a backpack)\n\n*Prohibited items that are discovered by city staff must be discarded or surrendered.

A PDF on the Cooling/Warming Center is available.\n\n\nThe Cooling/Warming Center hotline is (209) 456-8080. Call ahead to confirm hours of operation. Please e-mail our team at MantecaCWC@ci.manteca.ca.us with questions.\nCRITERIA FOR OPENING\n\n*Temperatures are based on information provided by the National Weather Service (http://www.weather.gov/)\n\n    Cooling Center will open when temperatures are 104F and above.\n    Warming Center will open when temperatures fall to 31F and below.\n    In addition to one of the two criteria above, the center will open only if there is sufficient staffing.\n\nCOOLING CENTER\n\nSpending a few hours in an air-conditioned environment can bring down the body's core temperature. Older or frail adults, homeless people, and persons with health conditions that may be made worse by hot weather should consider spending time in a cooling center, particularly between 1pm and 5pm when temperatures are at their highest.\n\nBeat the HEAT!\n\n    Drink plenty of water\n    Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and large amounts of sugar because they will dehydrate your body\n    Wear sun screen and reapply often\n    Avoid direct sun, seek shade while outdoors\n\nWARMING CENTER\n\nBitter cold temperatures are more than an inconvenience; they can pose a serious threat to health and safety. Getting out of the cold and into a warming center during the overnight hours can bring much relief from what can be unbearable temperatures.\n\nCope with the COLD!\n\n    Wear layers including hat and gloves\n    Keep as dry as possible\n    Avoid alcohol as it can dilate blood vessels and cause hypothermia\n    Seek shelter and limit outdoor activity\n\nPROHIBITED ITEMS\n\nTo provide a safer environment for the public and expedite entry into the City of Manteca Senior Center, citizens will not be permitted to bring the following items:\n\n    No animals (with the exception of service animals)\n    No drugs, including Marijuana\n    No tobacco products or e-cigarettes\n    No alcohol\n    No personal property (with the exception of a backpack)\n\n*Prohibited items that are discovered by city staff must be discarded or surrendered.

      "The Emergency Shelter is open 24 hours a day and families may reside in the Shelter for a maximum of three months. The Shelter's current capacity is twenty-eight women and children who are generally referred to PV Shelter Services by other social service agencies, schools, civic and/or religious organizations. There are occasionally density issues, and currently there is no capacity in the shelter for women with older male children (age is limited to twelve years old).\n\nPV Shelter Services is a collaborator with several community agencies to provide coordinated case management support. Shelter residents sign a contract to abide by strict program requirements. Working with their case manager, residents develop written individual life plans to find jobs, housing, immigration assistance, counseling, education, language programs, parenting and budgeting skills and how to access community resources.\n\n\nEach family is expected to save a substantial portion of their income from any source as well as establish at least five self-sufficiency goals. As a result of this tough love approach, approximately 75% of Shelter families move to stable housing, 70% have savings upon their departure and 65% have met at least three of the five self-sufficiency goals.\n\nTransitional Housing and Long Term Support Housing for Homeless Families\n\nThe Transitional Housing Program consists of thirteen housing units for homeless families. The maximum allowable stay in the Transitional Housing Program is 24 months which provides time for families to stabilize and also enables many homeless families to be helped over time.\n\nDuring their residency in the Transitional Housing Program, previously homeless families receive intensive case management as well as training in areas such as budgeting, job and parenting skills and methods to find and keep stable housing. Similar to the Emergency Shelter Program, there is a tough love strategy in place.\n\n\nTransitional Housing Program families also sign a contract to abide by strict program requirements. Each family member over the age of 18 develops a written individual life plan with their case manager. Residents are required to set goals and save money. Non-compliance with program requirements can result in termination of the program contract. To date, PV Shelter Services is proud to say that 85-90% of the families in this program find stable housing again and numerous families have even become homeowners.\n\nIn 2009, PV Shelter Services began a Longer Term Supportive Housing Program with four housing units. This program provides housing, and support services as needed, to families who are making progress toward stability but need more time to build their resources and skills. Residents in these units are supported with Section 8 funding which permits PV Shelter Services to charge market rent.",

      "The Medford Gospel Mission offers three types of shelter:\n\n1) Emergency (1-5 continuous days per month)\n2) Case Management (10 weeks while accomplishing goals)\n\n\n3) Discipleship (2 year transitional living program)\n\n\n* We also provide Emergency Shelter during inclement weather.\n\nWe provide dinner nightly in our free community restaurant called the Main Ingredient.\n\n\nOur free clothing store called the Outfit Outlet is open six days a week 9am-noon. Closed on Sunday.\n\nPrograms\nBecause people have challenges that are unique to their situation we have a variety of programs that can help enable them to conquer a wide range of obstacles:\nPrograms for Men\nPrograms for Women\n\nMen's Programs\nThe mens shelter offers two programs; one that is focused on setting and accomplishing short-term goals called the Getting Things Done (GTD) program and the other is focused on setting and accomplishing long-term goals called the Upper Room Transitional Living (URTL) program.\n\nThe Getting Things Done program is designed to help men that need more than a few nights shelter to get things done that will enable them to not be homeless. Men who sign up for this program are welcome to stay at the Mission for up to 10 weeks while working on things that will help them move forward. Some have jobs and need to save some money to get housing, others are awaiting to get into a program with another local social service agency, and others need assistance making a plan so they dont leave the Mission and return to homelessness. A majority of the men that stay with us through this program are able to work on solutions to their homeless problem and do not return to living on the streets after completing the program.\nThe Upper Room Transitional Living program is Christ Centered, Mentor Driven, and Goal Specific living in a safe and positive environment. With the help of one of our mentors, we help the individual succeed and leave the program better equipped to handle the challenges that come with everyday life.\nOur program consists of three pillars; spiritual growth, serving the community, and accomplishing personal goals. All three of these make up a well-rounded individual and member of our community. Spiritual growth comes through sitting under the preaching and teaching of the word of God. Therefore, program members are required to attend morning bible study and evening chapel services daily. They are also encouraged to find and join a local evangelical church where they can worship weekly. They also take an active part in serving the community by taking on tasks that serve our guests and help make the Mission a special place. Success comes as the individual sets personal goals and moves towards accomplishing them. These goals may be financial, relational, and/or educational.\nWe believe good things cant be rushed. That is the reason that the program is designed for a two-year stay. During this time we partner our men up with a mature Christian man to mentor them every step of the way. The first six months are spent learning to live a stable life away from destructive habits that they may have developed over the years. This is an opportunity for them to spend time caring for others and developing their spiritual life in a safe environment. During the second six months they focus on progressing in skills that will help them be successful in the future. This may include working with local agencies such as: Foundations for Recovery, Work Source Oregon, Vocational Rehab, and Rogue Community College. The final year consists of securing employment, which enables them to reduce debt and save money for future needs after they graduate and move on.\n\nThese steps, thoughtfully pursued coupled with the encouragement of the mentors and directors of the Medford Gospel Mission help these men succeed in their chosen, post-Mission path.\n\n\nWomen's Programs\nEmergency Shelter\nCheck in time is at 8:30pm nightly.\nPrograms\nWe do have programs designed to give women a hand-up out of the situation that they may find themselves in. We do intakes for women into these programs Monday-Thursday at 2:00pm.\nShort-Term Program:\nHelps women who are in need of more shelter than the initial ten nights that are provided and are working on solutions to their challenges.\nNew Beginnings Program:\nEnables women to live in a safe and encouraging environment while working on obligations that they may have with Childrens Services, Probation Department, or Out-Patient Programs.\nHouse of Esther:\nThis is a year-long program that is designed to help women through life-controlling issues while addressing life skills on a spiritual level through the study of the word of God.\n\n",
