With open doors and open hearts, more than 6,400 young people (16 - 21 years of age) in the St. Louis metropolitan area are provided programs and resources every year.As one of the leading St. Louis nonprofits servicing youth, CHMO is dedicated to providing hope, enrichment and a positive direction to all youth in need. This all-encompassing approach is housed within the CHMOs Center for Youth, a welcoming, bright environment with dorm-like floors and classrooms.\n\nIn addition to emergency shelter services, the Center for Youth provides educational resources, job skill development, personal counseling and numerous life skill classes.\n\n\nThere is also an extensive transitional living program where youth can live in the facility for up to two years. Moreover, youth with mental health issues who have left the CHMO program (for up to six months) are personally called by After-care Program staff to ensure stability and if essential needs are being met.Outside of the Center for Youth, CHMO staff bring awareness of youth homelessness and services to schools (safe outreach) and on poverty stricken streets (street outreach). The outreach team continuously educates the public and directly assists youth in crisis with resources and immediate supplies like food and clothing."

In 2014, The Lighthouse expanded its residences to meet the needs of the increasing number of homeless women and children in the Pine Belt. In addition to meeting basic needs, our residents are offered additional support programs in GED preparation, life skills and Bible studies. The Lighthouse strives to create a safe environment while sharing the love of Jesus Christ.\nThe typical homeless family in the Hattiesburg area consists of a mother in her early twenties who did not complete high school and may not have any work experience. According to Share International, 40% of homeless persons are in families. Homeless children also experience more mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and withdrawal. They are twice as likely to experience hunger and four times as likely to have delayed development. These illnesses have potential devastating consequences if not treated early.\nAt The Lighthouse Rescue Mission, we want each parent to succeed and each child to have a safe, warm, and fun place where they can simply be a child. Families will not stay for six to nine months to leave and not be changed; they will have had an opportunity to create a new life for themselves through the power and Spirit of Jesus Christ. Through His saving grace, they will be empowered to be the people that God has called them to be. We are offering a hand up, not a hand out.\n"

    "description": "Mountain of Faith Ministries (MOFM) has been a 501(c)3 faith-based organization since 2001. We currently operate as an emergency homeless shelter in Vicksburg, Warren County, Mississippi. The City of Vicksburg and the Mississippi Department of Human Services worked in concert to donate the facility, which MOFM named The Women's Restoration Shelter. Since opening in 2005, our Shelter has housed over 800 homeless women and children in our rural area. Homeless families come from the City of Jackson, Hinds, Madison, Rankin, Copiah, Warren and other surrounding counties. We rescue women and children from abandoned buildings, parked cars, under bridges and other destitute situations. Our initial goal is to feed, clothe and shelter homeless individuals and families. Once the initial assessment has been completed, we work to remove the barriers which caused the individuals or family to become homeless..OUR GOALSOur initial goal is bringing homeless individuals and families into our program and leading them through emergency homelessness. The ultimate goal is to guide residents to transitional living and finally to permanent housing. We aim to provide an environment which assists the homeless individual and families to become self-supportive, self-reliant and in a position to make a self-determination. Our outreach program contacts referents on occasion have brought the homeless into the programs from a situation which was not meant for human habitation."
