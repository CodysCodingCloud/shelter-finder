    "description": "The Bridge accommodates children from birth to 18 years of age. During their time with us, all their necessities are provided, including but not limited to food, clothing, shelter, recreation, job training, advocacy, education, medical attention, and counseling. We provide a safe and structured environment for these children, allowing them time to heal and grow. We have and operate a 12 bed facility. The Bridge is a six-bedroom, three-bathroom home, located in a confidential location. There is plenty of living space, yard space, spacious dining facilities, and various forms of recreation (i.e. books, games, etc.). Referrals are taken from number of sources, including but not limited to the Department of Family and Children Services, the Department of Juvenile Justice, law enforcement, juvenile court, and family members. We do accept all runaway and homeless youth, but most of our children are confirmed cases of abuse and neglect. Aftercare Services are offered to clients for up to 6 months.\n\nThe Transitional Living Program provides a safe and stable home for youth transitioning out of foster care or those youth who are homeless, between the ages of 18 and 21. This program aims to transition these disadvantaged youth into productive citizens in the community. The participants are placed into scattered-site apartments where the basic necessities (i.e. food, clothing, and shelter costs) are provided for them until they eventually phase out of the program in graduated phases. The phases consist of assuming financial responsibility for their living expenses, one bill at a time, until they are able to assume all financial obligations successfully and independently. Youth are required to work and have the option to attend school while working. Youth are enrolled in a mandatory savings plan that ensures that before they exit the program, they have a savings account balance that is able to cover at least three months of living expenses. Youth are assessed at intake to develop a written plan that includes youth needs, strengths, goals and objectives while in the program. Progress is evaluated monthly by our trained and professional staff. At exit, youth are expected to have achieved the goals in the plan as well as the overall goals of the design of this program. This program has seen great success in changing the lives of young adults in this area. Open Arms, Incorporated is the only provider for the Transitional Living Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth in Southwest Georgia. Aftercare Services are offered to clients for up to 6 months.\n\n\nThe Street Outreach Program is our newest addition. This program provides mentoring and prevention methods to street youth. Staff members in this program work in low income areas and in hot spots for troubled youth. The goal of this program is to reduce sexual exploitation and abuse of street youth. Our staff members provide a strong presence in the community and express genuine concern for the youth in order to facilitate relationships with the youth so that they will listen to advice offered, take advantage of the services and items given (i.e. brochures, resource contacts, hygiene items, contraceptives, etc.), and hopefully choose to exit the streets for a safer environment."

Call for details.\n\nThe Interfaith Hospitality Network (IHNA) service programs are formed from many already existing programs and resources in the local area. The benefit of using pre-existing assets is so we can react quickly and without major costs. Guests accepted in the network are eligible to receive the following services and assistance:\n\nHost Churches:\nWe have a network of local churches that volunteer to house our guests for one week at a time four times a year. When families enter our program they spend the night at one of these churches. At 5:00 they return to the church for the evening. The volunteers at the host church that week feed the guests supper and usually have family time or a mentoring class in the evening. Next morning these volunteers feed the guests breakfast and send them off with a sack lunch.\n\nEmployment Searches:\nAfter leaving the host church in the morning, the adults come to the Day Center. From there they are transported to job interviews, employment agencies, or wherever they need to be transported in their search for employment.\n\nTransportation:\nWhile in the program our guests and their children are provided with cost free transportation. Guests can be taken to and from various locations in conjunction with regaining their independence, while their children are taken to whichever school they were enrolled in prior to entering the program.\n\nDay Care Services:\nFPA operates a cost free Day Care Shelter for the children of our guests. Each morning the children who are not enrolled in school, or who are out of school, are transported to the Day Care center. Guests in transitional housing are still eligible for our day care services.\n\nPersonal Services:\nDuring their stay we try to ensure we meet all the needs of our guests including medical assistance and dental care. Life skills assistance, Budget Management and Parenting Classes are also offered. Assistance will be provided as needed with resumes, GED classes and navigating the job market.\n\nTransition to Independence:\nAfter our guests find stable employment they move to one of our transitional homes. When they move in we try to make sure they have everything they need. This includes furniture, linens, household items and transportation./p>\n\nTransitional Housing:\nAfter the adult of the family has found employment and has a stable income the family moves to one of our transitional homes; where they can stay, rent free, for up to two years. During their stay in transitional housing they are responsible for all other expenses and required to save 30 percent of their income as well as look for permanent housing. Regular meetings with the director is also required for all guest who enter transitional housing."

Providence Ministries Homeless Men's Shelter - Providence Ministries homeless shelter is on the forefronts of the fight against the homelessness epidemic in Georgia. We believe that every man deserves dignity and refuge as they attempt to put their lives back together. The homeless situation is a tragic one. It is often a result of the all to common occurrence of people losing both their homes and their jobs at the same time, and is not a reflection of character but rather the result of ill-timed and unfortunate circumstances. We know that the homeless condition can happen to anyone.\n\n\n2. Men's Addiction Recovery - The Providence Ministries Christian Drug and Alcohol Recovery Program for men has been redeeming lives and saving souls in the name of Jesus Christ, since 1985. Our time-tested, long-term 6 month faith based rehab alternative to traditional drug and alcohol rehabilitation treatment has helped people from all across the nation, is extremely value packed, and extremely effective.\n\n3. Women's Addiction Recovery - Drug rehab, Alcohol rehab. We are more then a recovery center, we are a spiritual regeneration program, and our goal is to help women completely transform their lives. website: http://providencewomensrecovery.com/\n\n4. Homeless Women's and Children's Shelter - This mission's purpose is to offer a temporary place of refuge for homeless women and their children while the mother addresses the economic, social, and spiritual issues that led to their homelessness. It is designed to give homeless women an opportunity to take a hard look at themselves, and to take the necessary steps to move out of the bondage of homelessness.\n\n\nThe program can house a total of 12 persons, that being any combination of women and children. The prerequisites for approval into the shelter are that the mother be homeless, not suffering from a physical or mental disability (as we are not medically staffed but can refer), and not be in danger or dealing with a domestic dispute or battered woman situation (again, we can refer).\n\n\nWe offer one-on-one counseling, complimentary meals for the mother and children, and a fully furnished living area separated from any of the men's facilities. That said, their are some requirements. First, we require that the mother be ardently looking for work during the day. Second, we require that the women remain free of drugs and alcohol, and third, we require that the family attend church on Wednesdays, and twice on Sunday's.\n\nWe have gone to great lengths to create a safe, second-to-none shelter. The opportunity for women to grow and heal with us here at Providence is very real and very attainable. And as long as the women staying here are putting in the effort, we will stand behind them and assist them in any way we can. For more information or if you have questions, please call the women's intake coordinator at (706)275-0268.\n\n5. Free Meals.\nHours:\nMondays through Fridays: Breakfast: 7:15am, Lunch 12 noon, Dinner 5pm.\nSundays: Breakfast: 8:30am, Lunch 12 noon, Dinner, 5pm.\n\nHot Meals.Providence Ministries is fighting hunger in Georgia by serving fresh and hot meals prepared daily, and offering them for free to anyone who wants one, no questions asked... no one will be denied. Our community kitchen is open 365 days a year and serves 60-200 plates for any given meal. Also, we very often redistribute any extra unprepared donated food to our guests immediately following the serving of food (limit one small bag per family). Please take advantage of these offers as it's our pleasure to serve the community in this very important endeavor, and we hate throwing away excess food."

The GHFA PSH Program is designed to serve a population that has been traditionally hard to reach - homeless persons with disabilities such as (but not limited to) serious mental illness, chronic substance abuse, and/or AIDS and related diseases. This program is built on the best practice that housing and services should be connected in order to ensure stability for this population. Consequently, GHFA PSH provides rental assistance that local sub-grantees must match with supportive services appropriate to the target population. The goals of the GHFA PSH Program are to assist homeless individuals and their families to increase their housing stability, skills and/or income, and self-sufficiency."

Our chapel speakers are volunteers who come once a month to encourage and be a blessing to those who need Christ in their lives.\n\nWomen's Chapel Service\nSeparate chapel services are provided each night for our female shelter guests and program members. Godly women from area churches volunteer their time to provide music and teach the Word of God so that these women can come to know Christ as Savior and learn to live for Him.\n\nChristian Life Programs\n\nMens Christian Life Program\nSome of those to whom we minister realize they need to make changes in their lives and will enroll in our 12-month alcohol and drug program. Because we believe that only the Word of God and His Holy Spirit can change lives, all our classes and programs are Biblically based. In addition to the extensive Bible training, our CLPs/WCLPSs receive counseling and encouragement. While in this program, all of their needs are provided for them free of charge.\n\nThe last three months of the Christian Life Program is a transition period.Â  CLPs work outside the mission but continue to stay at the mission where food, shelter, and guidance are provided.

The program is funded entirely by donations.\n\nLocated in downtown Lawrenceville, GA for the past 25 years, The Quinn House was founded by John and Carrol Quinn because they recognized a great need in Gwinnett County for assisting individuals and families on all levels. They began by bringing homeless families into their own home and as their outreach grew, so did The Quinn House. Over those 25 years, The Quinn House is now a multi-task, non-profit Outreach Operation that assists hundreds of people in Gwinnett County and in other areas of the State.\n\n\nOur Residential Program not only provides housing for the homeless, but also offers a 40-day Drug and Alcohol Program to help individuals get back on their feet and re-enter society in a stable and productive way. This Program is free and offers our residents an opportunity to develop a new way of thinking and developing self-esteem, along with decision-making that can lead them to steady employment and independent living again. We have approximately an 80% success rate with our residents for completion of the 40-day Program. At this time there are three homes available for housing of men and women, in addition to women with children in Gwinnett County. While we do not provide housing at our location in South Central Georgia (Washington County), at this time we do provide food, clothing, and furniture to those in need from our thrift store located there."

Using a holistic approach, Hope Rebirth seeks to empower homeless Adults and children to regain control over their lives, to attain self sufficiency and to obtain permanent housing.Funding: Operating cost will be met by donations from the community, businesses, and churches. We will have an in-house yard sale and these proceeds will help with day to day needs. All proceeds go directly to Hope Rebirth; there is no payroll. This effort is a total Christian-based out reach. We will be doing fundraisers from time to time. We would love to come to your church and/or organization and make a presentation of Hope Rebirth.Please call and we will set a time. Come and visit us and see what GOD is doing in your community. We need and welcome volunteers and donations for Hope Rebirth.Community Building; There is no better way to help people than getting to know them first. The key to solving social problems is human understanding. Adopt-A-Block is an outreach program designed to do exactly that. It's boots-on-ground, door-to-door outreach, tireless. lost-cost and effective.Once the community sees who we are and what we're about, we're able to get more personal information and begin to assist in many different ways. Our greatest desire is to truly have a relationship with folks so that they desire to bring change as well, in whatever way that's possible.If you're able to connect with someone, then solutions are easier to come by. In a community that's been labeled many different names, we have an opportunity to be part of it's Rebirth. This community is rich with wisdom and knowledge, but it has to be brought out. We'll do this by knocking on doors, saying hello, and beginning a relationship that will hopefully last a lifetime. So come and join Our Good Works."
