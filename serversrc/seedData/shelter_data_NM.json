The services provided byHopeWorks stress flexibility, accessibility, and comprehensive care, the qualities necessary to assist individuals and families out of homelessness.

Sager Day Shelter\nOur facility provides a place for individuals experiencing homelessness to rest, receive meals, clothing, showers, storage, and more all while obtaining supportive services and housing (to eventually exit their homeless episode).

According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, clients report an increase in perceived levels of autonomy, choice, and control in Housing First programs.Â  98% of homelessness individuals who are placed into some sort of permanent supportive housing remain stably housed.\n\n\nIn addition, clients using supportive services like case management are more likely to participate in job training programs, attend school, discontinue substance use, have fewer instances of domestic violence, and spend fewer days hospitalized than those not participating. For people with mental or behavioral issues, housing (coupled with case management) remains a key component for long term stabilization.\n"

In hard economic times the homeless rate increases sharply and there is no doubt that a record number of people will find themselves homeless in 2015. Even some people that do work just can't make ends meet and pay the rent. The Lighthouse provides shelter on a transitional or emergency basis making sure people aren't exposed to the weather or living out of a car.\n\nRECOVERY PROGRAM- Men & Women\n6 month residential drug and alcohol recovery program.\nThe Lighthouse Mission Discipleship Program is a 6 month residential recovery program. It is designed to help disadvantaged individuals who are battling life threatening addictions. A clean and sober environment is needed to heal physically, emotionally and spiritually. Each person enrolled will be given the 'tools of life' skills that will enable them to once again be productive members of society.\n\nCLOTHING BANK\nProviding gently-used clothingÂ  Monday-Thursday.\nÂ The Missions clothing bank provides new and used clothing, shoes, books, toys, household items and small kitchen appliances to those that cannot otherwise afford those items. Warm clothing is essential to our well-being. Presentable clothing can make the difference in that 'first impression' at a job interview or whether a child is accepted or ridiculed by their peers at school. Irrespective of being right or wrong this is a reality. Providing a family with decent clothing and shoes can boost opportunities in both employment and education and provide a path to rebuild their lives to become self-sufficient. Providing suitable toys and books for children can also lead to a more normalized life style. Volunteers sort through and categorize and organize these items for local assistance however many items are sent to impoverished countries as well.\n\n\nSOUP KITCHEN\nFighting hunger by providing well-balanced meals 7 days a week.\nIn 2014 The Lighthouse Soup Kitchen, also know as Bonner Hall, served 43,510 balanced meals(not including homeless shelter nighttime meals) to those in need. We anticipate a record year in 2015 as the struggle of our economy increases. Think about how your mind wanders that hour before you go to lunch then try to imagine not knowing where that next meal will come from. Nothing will discourage a person's heart and mind quicker than the pain of hunger. A education of a child suffers when they are hungry. Our bodies become subject to illness when we are weakened by malnutrition. Our hopes of employment and improvement vanish when our entire goal of our day becomes just finding food. Directly addressing this food insecurity is the first step in human recovery. Our minds begin to think more clearly when not being punished by the pain of hunger.\n\n"

This is our newest facility, created in response to the growing number of homeless women in our community. Before this facility was created, homeless women were housed in a separate area within the mens emergency shelter. It grew evident that this arrangement was problematic, and that the women could best be protected and supported in pursuing their goals given a separate facility. Now that the women have a safe place of their own, they have truly developed a supportive, community environment. The residents work together to maintain the shelter, advocate for each other, connect each other to resources, and encourage each other to make positive changes in their lives.\nAll residents receive three meals a day, clothing, and basic hygiene items. They are also connected with supportive case management services and have access to all the services the Opportunity Center has to offer.\n"
