    "description": "Since 1884, we have provided a temporary residential community environment to serve homeless men in Greater Hartford.\n\nOur Emergency Shelter is the oldest continuously operating facility of its kind on the east coast, founded in 1884. The Shelter operates from 3:30 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. 365 days a year, with a capacity of 25 beds. Guests enjoy relief from the elements, shower facilities, and a hot, nutritious dinner and breakfast. Furthermore, shelter guests, many of whom enter our doors with psychiatric disabilities, have access to a Master's level Mental Health Counselor. They receive community referrals vital to placing them on the path towards recovery from homelessness and the dangers associated with the streets. In addition, they are eligible to enter our Transitional Living Program and many do so. Those who do not proceed to the TLP are referred to other agencies for substance abuse treatment or mental health services.\n\nTransitional Living Programs\n\nWe are an 84 bed program for homeless and formerly incarcerated men, advocating for their recovery, work,and community integration.The dedication of our staff and the stamina and determination of our men is inextricable: we support and suggest; they labor toward the goals of education, sobriety, employment, and stable citizenship. Chronic relapsers are given another opportunity to recover 'with their own.' The sporadically employed are taught how to speak to an interviewer and rediscover a stalwart work ethic. The psychiatrically disabled are gently urged to clinical intervention. Like packages that contain limitless potential, our program carefully places men where they need to be and supervises their opening.\n\nSubstance Abuse Recovery Program\n\nThe Open Hearth is a program of recovery. If our residents cannot repudiate the cycle of addiction and homelessness, any chance of a stable, contented life is impossible. We aggressively address substance abuse, offering daily AA and NA meetings-in-house and in the community. Weekly recovery meeting are held, where residents and staff discuss recovery issues, always striving to improve and expand access to healing. A Recovery Coordinator supports and advocates for the men, researching recovery-oriented events, and handling the transportation logistics for dozens of men to community 12-Step meetings. All staff, particularly the men's counselors, commit to encouraging and monitoring their clients' sobriety.\n\nWorking Man Program\n\nThe Working Man's Center (WMC) is a systematic, formalized, step-by-step process for our clients to prepare for, pursue and find employment. Often the men who come thru our doors are not only unemployed, but unemployable. Though we offer in-house training such as ServSafe, Forklift Operator Certification, Basic Carpentry and more, the WMC is employment-driven and is as much a concept as it is a physical space."

Our facility is dormitory style as the beds are separated by dividers to accommodate a varying ratio of both men and women. The Shelter is not a \"residence,\" but rather an emergency location for overnight lodging. The Shelter is not open during the day, but our Soup Kitchen at 15 Prospect Street serves as a Day Room for those we serve in the Shelter.\n\nFor Shelter availability, all calls must go through the Greater Hartford Coordinated Access Network (GH-CAN) by calling 2-1-1\n\nIn order to access emergency shelters, ALL individuals and households in need of shelter, and/or their advocates/service providers must call 2-1-1 (1-800-203-1234 for SafeLink users) to enter the Greater Hartford Coordinated Access Network (GH-CAN) service system.  Callers should select option 3, then wait for option 1 to be patched through to a 2-1-1 Housing Specialist.\n    The 2-1-1 Housing Specialist will briefly interview the household and seek to refer them to existing prevention or diversion programs (i.e. Utility assistance, security deposit assistance, domestic violence programs, etc.)\n    If diversion and referrals are not possible and the household is within 48 hours of becoming homeless (on the streets or in a shelter), 211 will schedule a GH-CAN Assessment appointment with one of the GH-CAN providers, this appointment is typically a few weeks away.\n        The GH-CAN assessment will provide more robust diversion and completion of the Vulnerability Index Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool (VI-SPDAT) needs assessment. If shelter is deemed necessary, the household will then be referred to an available shelter bed.\n\n    If the household is in IMMEDIATE need of emergency shelter that night, 211 will call the GH-CAN Shelter Triage Staff to find a provisional bed assignment for the household at one of the GH-CAN's shelters (Hartford, East Hartford, and Vernon) until their assessment date. If there are not shelter beds available at that time, clients will be instructed to call back after \"curfew\" when it is known if beds have opened up that night.\n\nDuring the cold period from December 15 through March 15, the Cold Weather Protocol will be activated and households will be placed into available overflow solutions. In Greater Hartford when the Governor activates the Severe Cold Weather Protocol, some shelters will remain open 24 hours and towns may open warming shelters during business hours. Every attempt will be made to shelter individuals with the resources available."
