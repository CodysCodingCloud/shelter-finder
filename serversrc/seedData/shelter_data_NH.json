With our clients, Intake Case Managers develop a plan that will lead to employment and housing.\n\n\nSometimes it is the little things that require the help of a case manager, such as obtaining a form of identification, or accessing health care.  Other times the problems are long standing and difficult.  Either way our dedicated team of case managers provide support, education, and guidance on the road to housing and self-sufficiency.\n\nCase Managers promote overall stability, emphasizing physical and behavioral health and nutrition. When needed, our case managers work with those in need of drug/alcohol rehabilitation through relationships with local rehabilitation programs, as well as proving transportation.\nMany clients elect to enroll in continued Case Management to maintain stability while in housing."
