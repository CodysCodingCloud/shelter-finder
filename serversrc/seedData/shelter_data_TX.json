The main focus is to work with neighbors to secure a safe, affordable and stable housing to individuals and families as quick as possible. Individuals and/or families that have school-age children may be prioritized. Before moving in, neighbors will participate in an assessment to determine eligibility and services needed. At move-in, neighbors sign a participant agreement that outlines Bridge 2 Home policies and procedures. Each household is provided with a private room, basic cable, internet access, and groceries. Additionally, participants may utilize the following community spaces: kitchen, dining/living space, laundry facilities, and back/patio area.\nHope Housing Services (HHS)Is a rapid re-housing program for individuals and/or families experiencing homelessness. It combines housing identification, financial assistance, and case management services so that HHS staff support neighbors in securing safe, affordable, stable housing as quickly as possible. Prior to program entry, neighbors participate in an assessment to determine services needed and placement on the Housing Priority List. Because the focus is stability, neighbors sign a standard 12 month lease in their own name prior to moving into their home.Â \n\n\n"

Eliminating housing barriers allows all people the opportunity to move forward and become more stable and productive members of our community. Our housing efforts focus on the individual who may be facing challenges with housing solutions. Our goal is to move individuals from insecurity in housing to a variety of permanent solutions including home ownership. Our goal is not to transition those in need into a living space, but to work with them toward their long term goals for life and housing desires. Over 25 properties have been made available since 2014 for affordable ownership. Many of them are now owned by individuals and families who once saw homeownership as an unreachable dream.\n\nOur current housing division includes three distinct avenues to sustained living. For men, the New Life Center in the up-and-coming Fairmount Historic District offers housing for men who have faced homelessness. Women who are being released from incarceration can become part of the Promise House, a place that provides safe shelter while working toward building a new life based upon Christian principles. We work to provide affordable homes to individuals and families who are ready and willing to achieve this goal.\n\n\nNew Life Center\nNew Life Center is a home where men who have faced homelessness can focus on education and meeting their long-term career goals. During their residence, each man is provided supportive services such as case management, mentoring, and spiritual, physical, emotional, and financial guidance. Despite where these men may come from, their future possibilities are limitless. Residents graduate from college every year, including one resident who graduated as Valedictorian from TCU.\n\nThose interested in being a resident may complete the application and interview process in person, Monday mornings at 9:30 am. No appointment is necessary. Applicants must be currently homeless and drug- and alcohol-free.\n\n1628 Sixth Ave. Fort Worth, Texas 76104"

While utilizing the energy of over 2,800 community volunteers, together we are dedicated to serve families who seek to be accountable, resilient, and strive for a better tomorrow for their families.\n\nWe serve low-income families that become homeless due to an unfortunate circumstance, such as a fire, flood, the death of a spouse, loss of a job, an eviction, or a foreclosure of a home. Our families include infants, children, teenagers, and couples. Single men and anyone with serious psychiatric problems or those with current drug or alcohol addiction problems are not appropriate; however, we work closely with other shelters in the area to ensure that those we are unable to serve find shelter elsewhere.\n\n\nFamilies wishing to participate in our program are encouraged to contact the Day Center Monday through Friday at 281-441-3754 to make an appointment for an intake interview. Our families agree to participate fully in a self-sufficiency program and adhere to all of our program guidelines and rules during their stay in the Network. Family Promise of Lake Houston is a sober program, and requires all participants to agree to random drug testing as a condition of acceptance into FPLH.\n\nWe accept referrals from all organizations and locally we work in partnership with HAAM, Family Time, 211 Texas as well as the Humble ISD advocates.\n\nLife Skills Center\nMonday - Friday\n8 a.m. - 5 p.m.\nIntake interview appointments: 281-441-3754\n\nFPLH requires that families save 80% of their income while in our shelter. Without food and housing expenses our families are able to develop a reserve. This income base allows each family to take the necessary steps toward independence and a better life for themselves and their loved ones. The savings help with apartment escrow and home down payments.\n\nFamily Promise operates at less than 1/3 the average cost of most shelters, and does not accept State or Federal funding to provide any service to our families or community."

In hard economic times the homeless rate increases sharply and there is no doubt that a record number of people will find themselves homeless in 2015. Even some people that do work just can't make ends meet and pay the rent. The Lighthouse provides shelter on a transitional or emergency basis making sure people aren't exposed to the weather or living out of a car.\n\nRECOVERY PROGRAM- Men & Women\n6 month residential drug and alcohol recovery program.\nThe Lighthouse Mission Discipleship Program is a 6 month residential recovery program. It is designed to help disadvantaged individuals who are battling life threatening addictions. A clean and sober environment is needed to heal physically, emotionally and spiritually. Each person enrolled will be given the 'tools of life' skills that will enable them to once again be productive members of society.\n\nCLOTHING BANK\nProviding gently-used clothingÂ  Monday-Thursday.\nÂ The Missions clothing bank provides new and used clothing, shoes, books, toys, household items and small kitchen appliances to those that cannot otherwise afford those items. Warm clothing is essential to our well-being. Presentable clothing can make the difference in that 'first impression' at a job interview or whether a child is accepted or ridiculed by their peers at school. Irrespective of being right or wrong this is a reality. Providing a family with decent clothing and shoes can boost opportunities in both employment and education and provide a path to rebuild their lives to become self-sufficient. Providing suitable toys and books for children can also lead to a more normalized life style. Volunteers sort through and categorize and organize these items for local assistance however many items are sent to impoverished countries as well.\n\n\nSOUP KITCHEN\nFighting hunger by providing well-balanced meals 7 days a week.\nIn 2014 The Lighthouse Soup Kitchen, also know as Bonner Hall, served 43,510 balanced meals(not including homeless shelter nighttime meals) to those in need. We anticipate a record year in 2015 as the struggle of our economy increases. Think about how your mind wanders that hour before you go to lunch then try to imagine not knowing where that next meal will come from. Nothing will discourage a person's heart and mind quicker than the pain of hunger. A education of a child suffers when they are hungry. Our bodies become subject to illness when we are weakened by malnutrition. Our hopes of employment and improvement vanish when our entire goal of our day becomes just finding food. Directly addressing this food insecurity is the first step in human recovery. Our minds begin to think more clearly when not being punished by the pain of hunger.\n\n"
