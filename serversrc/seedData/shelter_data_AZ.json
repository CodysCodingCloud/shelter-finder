This means that families are provided their evening meal and the lodging at congregations across the Valley. Never more than five families at a time will stay with the hosting congregation for 7 nights in a row, coming back to the day center daily for resources, job searching, housing applications and case management. Maximum stay is 60 days, with a 70% success rate of securing sustainable housing for families who enter the program.\n\n3 Steps to Shelter with Family Promise\nÂ \nSTEP 1: Meet minimum Criteria:\nÂ Â Â Â  At least 1 parent and 1 child\nÂ Â Â Â  Drug and alcohol free,\nÂ Â Â Â  Ability and desire to secure employment\nÂ Â Â Â  No active domestic violence\nÂ Â Â Â  No violent felonies\n\nSTEP 2: Call to check space availability:Â  480-659-5227\nÂ Â Â  If full, call housing hub for waiting list (211)\n\nSTEP 3:Â  Schedule intake appointment, subject to:\nÂ Â Â  Criminal background check will be done in all 50 states\nÂ Â Â  On-site drug test will be done prior to acceptance\nÂ Â Â  On-site interview for final decision\nÂ Â Â  Invitation to move in to the shelter\n\n\nFamily Promises mission is to reduce homelessness in greater Phoenix by helping homeless and low-income families with children become self-sufficient. We do this with the help of a network of interfaith congregations that are passionate about serving homeless families. Together, our goal is to provide homeless families with a safety net of services so they can become independent and sustainable as a family unit.\n\nWe provide two programs Emergency Shelter and Transitional Housing. We accept only families with children, and are dedicated to keeping the family together. We have zero tolerance for substance abuse or violence, and accept into our program only parents able to work in the U.S.\n\n\nIn our Emergency Shelter we focus on resolving the familys immediate crisis and provide food, safe shelter, clothing, and help them find daycare, schools, employment and social services. Within 60 days the family has generally stabilized and a parent is employed. Now the family may be eligible to move into one of our affordable Transitional Housing units as they continue to learn to live independently. We continue to give encouragement and case management while they transition from homelessness to self-sufficiency.\n\nThe Family Promise program is a proven model that is highly effective in helping low-income people develop skills to improve their ability to earn a living wage and support their family and we maintain a success rate over 70%. Family Promise is a non-sectarian 501(c)3 charity qualified for the Working Poor Arizona Tax Credit."

This shelters main objective is to provide emergency shelter to those women and families who find themselves homeless and often without hope. Crossroads is in the business of restoring hope through the services offered to anyone seeking help.\n\n\nOur mission is to improve the well being of homeless children by providing them with case management and the opportunity to access community services which may help them improve the quality of their lives. The shelter helps the children get through a tough time by building memories in an environment of love and caring staff members. Parents are given the opportunity to access services from Crossroads or other agencies and continue to work or to look for work.\n\nWe offer all of the same services as the Men's Emergency Shelter. We try hard to help women and families achieve an independent lifestyle. We also serve as a refuge for families or women who are escaping an abusive environment. Our case managers work with each family on a case-by-case basis to try to determine which course of action will best help the family. We help with everything from enrolling children in school or daycare to referrals to agencies. Our goal is to provide services that make the least disruption for the children but the most helpful for the parents. Families are important. Crossroads philosophy includes family reunification, support, and functionality.\n\n\nHomeless women can access services by apply at the Family Shelter. The friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable case managers will assist guests with obtaining identification, apply for food stamps or AHCCCS and other important connections to restoring their life to normal.\n\nMeals at Crossroads Mission\nThe kitchen and dining room are the hub of the Mission.Â  There is non stop activity from 4:00 AM to 7:00 PM.Â  Over 400 meals are cooked and served each day to hundreds of program participants, overnight guests, and needy people.\n\nOur dinners are always free and open to the public!\n\nEveryday our dining room is visited by hundreds of people.Â  Some are homeless men, women, and children that will eat their only meal of the day at our table.Â  Others are individuals and families that have a home but for some reason are not able to make ends meet.\n\nWeekdays:\nBreakfast\n5:30 to 6:30 AM\n\nLunch\n11:30 AM to 12:00 PM\nÂ \nDinner\n5:00 to 6:00 PM\n\nWeekends and Holidays:\nBreakfast\n6:00 to 7:00 AM\n\nLunch\n12:00 to 1:00 PM\n\nDinner\n5:00 to 6:00 PM\n\nAll meals are open to everyone at Crossroads Mission and to the general public.Â  Anyone can come and eat with us.\n"
